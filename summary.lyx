Motivation: Construct a Bell like test for the case where the system is
 not two level, but d-level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Setup: Consider a 4 mode light.
 One direction is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 and the other is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}'$
\end_inset

.
 The annihilation operators are 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=a_{k}^{\parallel}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}=a_{k}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 and similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{4}$
\end_inset

 are defined.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Next, we also allow some photon number conserving transformations.
 One possibility would be 
\begin_inset Formula $a\to Ua$
\end_inset

, where

\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Recall: Single mode light: Take a plane wave like solution for a cavity
 and quantize it to get quantum optics.
 In this you'll get 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) of this classical solution.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

N mode light: You allow arbitrary plane waves.
 You'll get 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k},a_{k}^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 but for a given direction, you can have two polarizations (which are enough
 to generate all polarizations)

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/summer] Read Haridichi's paper about measuring a bounded observable
 using a two level system
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Implicitly it had used results from POVMs; so had to read about POVMs from
 Nielsen's book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Couldn't still fully understand what Ali was doing, I figured that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}^{\dagger}A_{i}$
\end_inset

 type of operators if they satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum A_{i}^{\dagger}A_{i}=\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

, then one can talk about probability of getting the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 input as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle A_{i}^{\dagger}A_{i}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Ali was using 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{+}+E_{-}=\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 as his scheme.
 However, for projectors, since 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{2}=P$
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{\dagger}=P$
\end_inset

, then the condition stated earlier essentially becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum P_{i}=\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 and that makes sense.
 However, they aren't projectors.
 So I wasn't sure what was happening.

Ali updated the minor modifications slightly (I still wasn't comfortable
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{two}=E_{+}-E_{-}$

 having only two possible values) | wasn't very happy intially but figured
 it today that this statement is not quite needed and had sent the update
 to Ali, who while made minor changes, wasn't too happy :(
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Putting it on arxiv required some debugging etc.
 | moral of the story is to use PDF as images instead and not using hyperref

He talks about how in CStat Mech, we use the function

Finally figured why 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{dt}d\Omega=(\nabla.v)d\Omega$

 The idea was to use the jacobian to describe the change in volume and then
 everything follows.

\begin_layout Itemize
Tried to look up papers related to Bohmian Mechanics and Contextuality (couldn't
 find too many papers related to this)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory, page 67 is a chapter on contextuality
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Can I think of a way of constructing a theory that's local, but not real?
 Can reality then be emergent? Does it mean that the moment I say I don't
 assume reality, then it must mean that my theory must have some sort of
 measurement and then it is essentially a combination of worst of both worlds?

[research/ms] Why must contextuality only be talked about in the context
 of spins? What about phase space contextuality? 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Reading Holland; following is a summary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To understand the continuity equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho+\nabla.(\rho v)=0$
\end_inset

, examples of 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 are taken
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $v=v(x)$
\end_inset

, a solution is obtained as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(x,t)=\frac{1}{v(x)}v\left[x\left(t-\int\frac{dx}{v}\right)\right]\rho_{0}\left[x\left(t-\int\frac{dx}{v}\right)\right]
\]

\end_inset

in which further assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 results in 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=A/\left|v(x)\right|$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $v=v(t)$
\end_inset

 then we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho(x,t)=\rho_{0}\left(x-\int vdt\right)
\]

\end_inset

which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is constant along particle trajectories
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
connection with Liuoville's equation
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,p,t)$
\end_inset

 is defined instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x,t)$
\end_inset

.
 Pure and mixed states are defined accordingly as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,p,t)=\rho(x,t)\delta(p-\nabla S(x,t))$
\end_inset

 being pure and the remaining as mixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{df}{dt}=\partial_{t}f+\frac{1}{m}\sum p_{i}\partial_{x_{i}}f-\sum\partial_{x_{i}}V\partial_{p_{i}}f=0$
\end_inset

 is the Liuoville's equation (which holds since we can show that the volume
 doesn't change under Hamiltonian evolution and particles inside the volume
 stay inside; 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p',q',t+\delta t)=f(p,q,t)$
\end_inset

 is essentially the statement 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{df}{dt}=0$
\end_inset

) which is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One may project out the moment space.
 They define equivalent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)=\int fd^{3}p$
\end_inset

, mean momentum as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{p_{i}(x)}=\frac{\int p_{i}fd^{3}p}{P(x)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{p_{i}p_{j}(x)}=\frac{\int p_{i}p_{j}fd^{3}p}{P(x)}$
\end_inset

.
 The louvielle equation can then be expressed in terms of these spatial
 variables.
 Integrating it we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{t}P+\frac{1}{m}\sum\partial_{x_{i}}(P\overline{p_{i}})=0.
\]

\end_inset

To get the momentum transport equation, after multiplying the louvielle
 equation with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and integrating, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{t}(P\overline{p_{i}})+\frac{1}{m}\sum\partial_{x_{j}}(P\overline{p_{i}p_{j}})+P\partial_{x_{i}}V=0
\]

\end_inset

 (apparently integrated by parts and assumed 
\begin_inset Formula $f\to0$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\to\infty$
\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

While 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is constant along a phase space trajectory, the spatial density 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 (equivalent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

) is not.
 It's apparent from the derivation of the continuity equation; either we
 start with a fixed volume or a fixed number of particles, not both.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $f=\rho\delta(p-\nabla S)$
\end_inset

 as stated earlier, you'd get 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{p_{i}}=\partial_{x_{i}}S$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{p_{i}p_{j}}=\partial_{x_{i}}S\partial_{x_{i}}S$
\end_inset

 as expected.
 The substitution also yields what's called a field theoretic version of
 Newton's Laws given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{t}\rho+\frac{1}{m}\nabla.(\rho\nabla S)=0
\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\partial_{t}+\frac{1}{m}\sum\partial_{x_{i}}S\partial_{x_{j}}\right]\partial_{x_{i}}S=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Remarks: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It's not obvious that if we start with a state that has well defined momentum
 (delta distribution) but the positions are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

, then they will continue to be well defined in momentum.
 This happens only exceptionally.
 In general, a pure state maybe sent to a mixed state.
 We'll see examples of these.
 [todo: ensure examples make sense]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can we decompose any mixed ensamble into a linear combination of pure ones?
 The answer's no.
 [proof?] Say there are many solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation,
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we can construct a linear combination as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,p,t)=\sum P_{i}\rho_{i}(x,t)\delta\left(p-\nabla S_{i}(x,t)\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 (degenerate notation) refers to the distribution of momenta at a given
 point.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum P_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 is assumed for normalization.
 Claim is that this is not in general possible to decompose a state into
 this form.
 An explicit example is that of reflecting through a potential barrier (in
 CM) [todo: ensure the example works]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
While this is not particularly useful in CM (the pure and mixed states),
 the formalism helps in comparison with QM.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

Illustration: We see that 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}(x,p)=\delta(x-x_{0})\delta(p-p_{0})$
\end_inset

 remains sharp
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(it can be checked by inserting it in the louviel equation) to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,p)=\delta(x-x(t,x_{0},p_{0}))\delta(p-p(t,x_{0},p_{0}))$
\end_inset

 [this is expected, since you're in essence saying there's only one particle]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Illustration 2: We want to see what happens to a Gaussian like state, does
 it spread?
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We start with 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}=\frac{e^{-x^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}=px$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 constant.
 This form of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

 has already been solved for and tells us 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\frac{e^{-(x-vt)^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}$
\end_inset

.
 There's no spreading classically! We'll see for the same initial conditions,
 what happens quantum mechanically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Illustration 3: What initial conditions yield a spreading Guassian? We start
 with the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{0}$
\end_inset

 but use 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}=\frac{m(x-x_{0})^{2}}{2t}$
\end_inset

, in which case the solution we saw the result is

[research/ms] Concluded that I'll just ask sir now for some advice.
 What I'm doing doesn't seem to help;
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So we start with 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dS=\oint\nabla S.dx=\oint p.dx=\int\nabla\times p.da$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dS=nh$
\end_inset

, then we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times p=\sum_{a}\Gamma_{a}\int_{\gamma_{a}}\delta(x-x_{a})dx_{a}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the nodal line.
 If we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dS=nh$
\end_inset

 holds, then can we construct some example of the same? Let's first see
 how 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dS=nh$
\end_inset

 can be derived.
 If the only condition is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is single valued, then we know that at any point, 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 both yield the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $S'=S+nh$
\end_inset

.
 If one considers a loop, then say we start from a point 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Then after completing some distance, the change in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S$
\end_inset

.
 So the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{a}$
\end_inset

will be 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{a}+\Delta S$
\end_inset

.
 Now if we come back to the point 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, then from uniqueness of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, we only demand 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{a}+\Delta S=S_{a}+nh$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 itself was unique, then we'd say 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{a}+\Delta S=S_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Now at this point itself I seem to have trouble.
 I have tacitly assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is single valued when I'm evaluating the `change is 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

' along the curve.

Talked to manu for a while and made some progress, then figured it was non-sense
 and made some more progress.
 Finally, Manu found a document that helped clarify a few things.
 The issue was still that they had used a vector field and not a potential.
 And it wasn't clear to me what potential must I use in that case.

[research/ms] Finally found a potential that works (looked at acheson, griffiths
 and an extra document that manu had found.)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The potential is 
\begin_inset Formula $V=k\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Note how this is itself, as a function of position is multi valued and
 yet we never have any issues integrating this (as we'll see shortly).
 While 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is multivalued, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla V=\frac{k}{r}\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is happily single valued :) And not just that, check this; 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint_{\gamma}\nabla V.dx=2\pi$
\end_inset

 (simply because 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is chosen to be a circle and then 
\begin_inset Formula $dx=rd\theta\hat{\theta}$
\end_inset

).
 Since in the domain of interest, everything is well defined, I can write
 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint_{\gamma}\nabla V.dx=\oint_{\gamma}dV=2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 And one can show independently (I know only a simple minded proof with
 discritizing the function) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dV=0$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is single valued (or a function).
 So what does this example show? Various rather peculiar things.
 (I) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint dV$
\end_inset

 maybe non zero for a reasonable physical situation by virtue of multivaluedness
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Yes, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is multivalued and yet we can integrate the said expression without ambiguity.
 (II) that there happens to be a singularity within the loop, over which
 the integral is non-zero.
 (III) The curl, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times\nabla V\neq0$
\end_inset

 at the center and 
\begin_inset Formula $=0$
\end_inset

 else.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Now we've made plausible various things which would've seemed arbitrary
 otherwise.

[research/ms] Worked out an explicit example of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times p=\sum_{a}\Gamma_{a}\int_{L^{(a)}}\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^{(a)})d\mathbf{x}^{(a)}$
\end_inset

 by assuming that the 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{x}^{(a)}$
\end_inset

 term is infact a vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is essentially 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}dxdy$
\end_inset

 to see that everything fits well eventually.
 Then I moved to the next section and everything seemed alright.
 Basically the discussion of the 'quantum potential term', viz.
 the term which if removed would reduce the expression to a classical hamilton
 jacobi equation, was slightly confusing.
 This term is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $Q:=-(\hbar^{2}/2m)\nabla^{2}R/R$
\end_inset

, and yet the claim is that this essentially depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The same can be said of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 which depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 which in turn can be determined only once 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is specified (NB: 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 contains information about both the Hamiltonian and the momenta of the
 system).
 So in this sense, both 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 However, the distinction seems to be made on the following ground: if 
\begin_inset Formula $V=V(x)$
\end_inset

 then, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla S$
\end_inset

 is sufficient.
 However, for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 it seems higher derivatives will also be necessary.
 Why this makes any difference, I am yet to learn.

 Why can't I think of a bohmian like picture, after a particle has been

 Perhaps I should start playing with the scalar field theory and try to
 see how I can get bohmian trajectories into them somehow.
 I suppose the eventual goal would be to think of an alternate interpretation
 to the field interpretition.
 I feel that there's some better way of handling these things.

 In QFT we treat the dirac equation as a field and create particles off

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Was trying to translate bohmian mechanics to the discrete
 case.
 Realized there'll be an issue with the grad operator but then in the case
 of spins, we never write the kinetic energy term! Then some discussion
 with Jaskaran got me realize the following rather interesting conflicting
 statements, at least for spins.
 (I) QM is non local; Essentially if you assume locality, you can show determini
sm must exist, using EPR type states.
 Now one can use Bell's inequality to show QM is non local.
 (II) QM is non-deterministic can be shown using contextuality arguments
 and coloring theorems.; Comment A: Regarding the conclusion of (I), it is
 weakened by the fact that one can show you in QM, you can't communicate
 faster than speed of light.
 So in this sense the non locality is, well is it there at all?
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Infact, one can show that the bell's inequality can be violated by 2 if
 the only assumption is no communication.
 QM does 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So whatever this non-locality, it is certainly more restrictive than simply
 enforcing 'relativity'.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Comment B: Disregard (I) for the moment.
 Usually in starting a proof for Bell's theorem, we assume that both locality
 and determinism hold (whether one can be derived from another is another
 matter).
 Thus a violation entails atleast one of the assumptions is wrong.
 We don't know which.
 From (II) it seems therefore that atleast determinism is false.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I had been told that in contextuality, certain other assumptions have to
 be made (of which I'm not certain).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Comment C: If only (I) were true, then constructing a theory such as Bohmian
 mechanics may seem strange because then non-locality is explicit, but in
 some sense more sensible for we don't need 'observers' to make sense of
 what we're saying.
 If (II) is true even in continuous variables, then it would seem meaningless
 to even imagine constructing a theory such as Bohmian Mechanics.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There maybe defenses such as the observables are not really the same as
 the object's position/momentum etc.
 but more on that later
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Conclusion: One needs to come up with either a contextuality test for continuou
s variables (Ali's work) or figure how to setup Bohmian Mechanics for discrete
 variables.

 measurement disturbs the values of the hidden variable; this is essentially
 how they explain spins, or even position/momentum uncertainty etc.; the
 basic idea then is that how is Bell's test acceptable? Because the contextualit
y tests are also built like so and they get away with it by saying that
 contextuality is about spins, and that is not really ontological.
 However, now they even have continuous variable contextuality! These need

[research/ms] Arun delivered the talk.
 He was insisting on the epistemic view of science.
 He said two things which are relevant for my work.
 First was the idea of a reduced density operator and its connection with
 Bohmian Mechanics.
 Detlef's book has discussed this.
 The next idea which is more directly relevant at the moment is that of
 the GHZ test.
 He was happily asserting that there the notion of reality must be given
 up.
 It was then obvious for me to use this as the starting point for my project.
 The continuous version of the GHZ test already exists and it would be fun

[research/ms] Found an interesting paper that discusses how bohmian mechanics
 handles Bell, GHZ and more.
 Infact, finally I figured precisely what it is that I'll work on.
 Instead of looking at contextuality per say, I would instead look at the
 GHZ test generalized to position and momentum.
 The paper I found could be useful in setting up the system.
 In essence then I must look at the following: (1) How is measurement generalize

 continuous variables (3) GHZ test in Bohmian mechanics

[research/ms] Idea: Why is it that position/momentum can't be used to harness,
 essentially arbitrary quantumness? Why do we rely on formalism similar
 to spins for extending to the CV setting?; Next, working on the numerical
 simulations.
 It's going good.
 About to simulate the schrodinger equation in a very simple case.
 Then we'll see the bohmian trajectory for a single particle!; In practice
 however, I am running into issues with attempting to simulate the schrodinger
 equation.
 The point is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is needed at arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and that's not possible without interpolating 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}\psi(q)$

Since I couldn't find anyone (surprisingly) to help me with this, I simply
 interpolate, using Ref

.
 However, I just realized (after having almost written the whole code) that
 the spline interpolation is for reals, not for complex.
 I think it can be readily extended, but then I'd have to mess around with
 spline function! :(

[research/ms] finished putting all the pieces together and debugging all

 simply because 
\begin_inset Formula $m1$

 I tried fixing this by taking absolute values and it still wouldn't give

 No help.

[research/ms] Working on trying to figure why the code's not working.
 Now I'm in a situation where I 'print' an object (of custom type) before
 sending to a function and then inside that function.
 They produce different results.
 WTH! Anyway, trying to figure this.
 In one attempt found a way to add procedures to types themselves (like
 a class).
 Apparently, the proof of concept code works in isolation but is'nt working
 with my code.
 Trying to figure that.
 Man Fortran's killing me today.
 So figured that.
 Here's the deal: when using procedures within a type, do the following:
 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

type contVar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	integer :: someVariables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	contains      
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		procedure, pass :: contVarAllocate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end type contVar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

contains
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

subroutine contVarAllocate(this,val)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	class(contVar) :: this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	integer :: val
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	this%someVariables=val
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end subroutine contVarAllocate
\end_layout

\end_inset

The most important point in all of this is that you've to use the keywords
 
\emph on
class
\emph default
 when you're using the datatype inside a class.
 The drawback is that doesn't fix the issue still :( 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Next I tried debugging using dgb.
 Spent quite some time, only to find that indeed before and after sending
 the values are different.
 :( 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Eventually tried writing a code with an allocatable array separately and
 that apparently does work alright.
 Alright, 
\emph on
figured
\emph default
 it.
 The issue was that the return type of my function was real and the value
 I intended to return was complex.
 So for some reason, that issue was rising.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Even after resolving it, it just won't work.
 Neither with Euler nor with RK4.
 It just won't evolve properly.
 The norm goes crazy.
 Now I have no clue why it isn't working.

[research/ms] Still can't figure what's really wrong.
 Checked the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}\psi$
\end_inset

 evaluated using the discrete difference formula and compared it to differentiat
ing the interpolated polynomial.
 The latter looked better, but the difference isn't all that marked.
 I suppose I'd be forced to use FFT after all.
 I suppose the basic difficulty is that in this 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\psi}$
\end_inset

 involves a double derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 itself, whereas in all previous cases that I considered, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 will usually be a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{m}$
\end_inset

 etc.
 Anyway, changing the approach at this stage doesn't feel feasable.
 I doubt anyway that this will work.

Talked to sudeshna ma'am.
 While talking to her, realized that we have to keep the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t/\Delta x^{2}\le10^{-6}$
\end_inset

 or so for euler and 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 or so for RK4.
 I had made another small mistake.
 I was returning only the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}\psi$
\end_inset

 initially (in the differentiation of the interpolate polynomial method).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Talked to Abhishek sir and realized that I wasn't really using RK4.
 I had made a mistake in understanding how to implement.
 Affter the discussion figured that, fixed it and it started working! The
 mistake was that I was using different 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

s for finding 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1},k_{2},\dots$
\end_inset

 whereas to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

 for example, I needed 
\begin_inset Formula $x+0.5\,dt\,k_{1}$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

is complex in general.
 So I already had hints on things going wrong.
 But I realised after that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi+0.5\,dt\,k_{1}$
\end_inset

 is what I had to use because in some sense, I'm treating 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 as a functional.
 So, given an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, I have to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\psi}$
\end_inset

 at different 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

s not different 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

s.
 So that fixed things.
 It was sad though because the interpolation code was completely useless!

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Got almost all basic stages to work.
 Was able to get the harmonic oscillator (as was done yesterday).
 Improved on the parameters.
 Then attempted to get one particle trajectory.
 And it worked! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As it turns out, interpolation was not useless but rather important.
 This is because I needed to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 at different 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

s and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(q)$
\end_inset

.
 So in effect I needed both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\psi$
\end_inset

 at arbitrary points.
 This worked well because I had already the interpolation code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next was to generalize this to handle an ensamble of particles.
 This was done by extending the interpolation code to handle arrays naturally
 and then the beauty of fortran kicked in and everything eventually started
 working smooth.
 Ofcourse I had made minor mistakes here and there, for example trying to
 add precision(real) to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 so that I don't get a division by zero in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 but that doesn't work like expected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anyway, after all of this, I realized that I need one last thing.
 I must start with particles distributed according to 
\begin_inset Formula $|\psi|^{2}$
\end_inset

and then evolve them.
 This did work finally.
 For this I wrote an algorithm, which was similar to the one I figured as
 an answer to Bagla sir's question in the computational physics course.
 That was a standard method of using the cumulative distribution and then
 inverting it.
 This new method was basically something that can be, unlike the former,
 generalized to arbitrary dimensions (at least intuitively, haven't proven
 this).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The algorithm is simply this.
 Start with finding the maximum of the probability density function, call
 it 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

.
 Then construct an interval from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

 and successively choose a point in this interval, and move in constant
 steps; at some iteration, call this point 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 Next, construct random numbers uniformly in the relevant range (over which
 the PDF is defined; viz.
 the relevant domain if you're fussy).
 Let's call it for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Then check if 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)>h$
\end_inset

.
 If it is, then you accept this point (save it in some array that'll represent
 the set of points which follow the said distribution).
 Else you reject the point.
 Repeat this a fixed number of times for each 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

.
 The claim is the set of points you get will satisfy the same PDF.
 Why it works is intuitively obvious.
 Start with considering 
\begin_inset Formula $h=0$
\end_inset

.
 All points are accepted.
 Then as 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 increases, fewer and fewer points are accepted; viz.
 those which are more likely according to the PDF, get more representation
 in the final set of points.
 This is readily generalizable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is however a major draw back.
 How many particles you'll have in the final array is stochastic in this
 algorithm.
 However, this can be easily fixed.
 Consider the further generalization.
 Find 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 uniform randomly and then find 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 uniformly randomly as stated.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is accepted, good else repeat till you have enough particles.
 Because of the stochastic nature of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 sequentially, or selecting it randomly, both are equivalent.
 The latter however allows for an obvious way of fixing the number of particles.

[misc] Various maintenance tasks: inbox gmail issue, hdd ordering, git repositor
y issue, updated the log for various days.
 tel Figured the plan of action.
 So I must choose between LQG and String Theory.
 Provisionally I have chosen LQG.
 I have already started applying to places in Europe keeping this in mind.
 Now for US also, I can do the same.
 The only issue is that LQG may not be the best idea.
 To that end, the strings conference may be the optimal place to figure
 things.
 I think thus that I should apply to 3 places that do loop (for US) and
 then if after talking to some of these people I get more input, perhaps
 I can apply to 1 or 2 more places.
 First thing is that I should try to get a TOEFL waiver for these places.
 I must parallely apply to two places a day in Europe.
 One in Germany and one in France.

The next thing is to revise physics/prepare for TIFR etc.
 That I think I'll start from tomorrow.
 Should perhaps spend atleast one hour on typesetting the documentation.

[research/ms] Initiated thinking | Realized that I need an optimized operator
 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $Y'=U^{\dagger}YU$
\end_inset

 so that my commutations are preserved.
 This doesn't seem all that trivial.
 The other approach is to construct everything for the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 instead of the position 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, where the periodicity is natural and can be harnessed to construct eigenstates
 quite naturally.
 To progress along this direction one needs to construct the momentum operator
 in the polar coordinates.
 Now we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla=\hat{r}\partial/\partial r+\hat{\theta}(1/r)\partial/\partial\theta+\hat{\phi}(1/r\sin\theta)\partial/\partial\phi$
\end_inset

 and thus one can imagine how to construct the `radial component of the
 momentum operator'
\begin_inset Formula $\equiv\hat{p}_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 However as it turns out, the more useful quantity (routinely encountered)
 is the radial part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{2}$
\end_inset

, where by part I mean the one that can be separated/depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Why that's an issue is because first of all, one must know what it means
 to talk about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{r}$
\end_inset

 as one can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{r}=\text{symmetrized\{}r^{-1}(-i\hbar\nabla).r\text{\}}$
\end_inset

 and that itself becomes slightly messy.
 Then one must know how this will be measured.
 I already am not very clear about the momentum is measured off of the screen
 in our earlier work, let alone in polar coordinates.
 This however doesn't mean it is a dead end.
 I'll try to explore the first direction first.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One quick calculation one can attempt is to try to swap the position of
 the following operators (attempt a commutation like behaviour): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
e^{i\hat{x}_{\text{mod}}\hat{p}L/L'h}.e^{i\hat{p}L_{2}/h} & = & \left(1+\hat{x}_{mod}\hat{p}L/L'h+\left(\hat{x}_{mod}\hat{p}L/L'h\right)^{2}+\dots\right).e^{i\hat{p}L_{2}/h}=\text{<after some calculation> }\\
 & = & e^{i\hat{p}L_{2}/h}e^{i(\hat{x}+L_{2})_{\text{mod}}\hat{p}L/L'h}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the distance over which the position is modulo over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next one can try to ask a more relevant question, which is: Does 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\,\text{a }U$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\hat{p}Lf(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}})/h}=\hat{U}^{\dagger}e^{i\hat{p}L/h}\hat{U}$
\end_inset

 ? One approach to this is to find the `matrix elements'.
 This doesn't yield an exact solution.
 Can see the calculations if you wish.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Was able to make good progress today.
 So here's what I did.
 First of all, consider the same states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle ,\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=8$
\end_inset

, as those considered in my first paper.
 Recall that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}$
\end_inset

 as defined there, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{q}_{\mod2L})$
\end_inset

, or more precisely as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{q})=\text{sgn}(\sin(\hat{q}\pi/L))$
\end_inset

, we had 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle =-\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 In addition to this, I define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}=e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$
\end_inset

 (as opposed to defining it to be hermitian).
 Now, we know that
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{\pm}\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\end_inset

 is not an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

.
 
\color blue
We infact used expectation values there and were able to show that for high
 enough 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, everything works out alright.
 Keeping the operator simple, helps retaining the commutation relations
 to a reasonable degree and consequently makes it easier to arrive at a
 violation.
 Now however, if we construct a more optimized operator, we might just be
 able to get away with requiring precise commutation relations to hold.
 
\color inherit
So we optimize the observable 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'\equiv\hat{X}\hat{T}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\equiv e^{i\hat{p}NLa(\hat{q})/2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a(q)=\begin{cases}
1 & 2L<q<4L\\
0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}.
\]

\end_inset

The idea is that you shift certain peaks to the right place, before applying
 the displacement operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

.
 To illustrate this, consider explicitly 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left(\left|\varphi_{-4}\right\rangle +\left|\varphi_{-2}\right\rangle +\left|\varphi_{-1}\right\rangle +\left|\varphi_{-3}\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{4}$
\end_inset

.
 The operation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\left|\varphi_{4}\right\rangle =\left|\varphi_{-5}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\left|\varphi_{3}\right\rangle =\left|\varphi_{-6}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle =\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2\}$
\end_inset

.
 It is now evident that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'=\hat{X}\hat{T}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Note also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'^{\dagger}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 does the same.
 So finally, now consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right\rangle \equiv\left(\left|\psi_{0}\psi_{0}\psi_{0}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{1}\psi_{1}\psi_{1}\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\equiv\hat{X}'\otimes\hat{Y}'\otimes\hat{Y}'^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}'\equiv i\hat{Z}\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

, calculations yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\left|G\right\rangle =\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\equiv\hat{Y}'^{\dagger}\otimes\hat{X}'\otimes\hat{Y}'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\equiv\hat{Y}'\otimes\hat{Y}'^{\dagger}\otimes\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

 also, by symmetry we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\left|G\right\rangle =\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}\left|G\right\rangle =\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}\equiv\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}=\hat{X}'\otimes\hat{Y}'\hat{X}\hat{Y}'^{\dagger}\otimes\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}\equiv\hat{X}'\otimes\hat{X}'\otimes\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

 yield the paradox.
 If values were predefined, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}$
\end_inset

 would return the same answer.
 However, a simple calculation yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}\left|G\right\rangle =\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (this can be seen directly by applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A},\,\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 sequentially on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 [was figured the next day]), while 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}\left|G\right\rangle =-\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Figured that even 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}$
\end_inset

 is not all that trivial to measure.
 For instance, for a free particle, measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 is enough.
 Now consider a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential and is in an
 eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}$
\end_inset

.
 Now ofcourse, the energy of the particle can't be measured by measuring
 the position and momentum (
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

) unlike in classical mechanics where the very state of the system is defined
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 and once that's known, every function of it is well defined.
 This is the very first, almost trivial 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{q},\hat{p})$
\end_inset

 which can be investigated to understand how one can measure such quantities
 in general.
 Talked to Bagla sir and he couldn't help.
 During the Cosmology and Gravitation class, I figured doing the following
 may help.
 (1) Take the large 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 limit and see how with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 both, one gets the same result on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 (2) Consider using expectation values for your result and measure that
 directly.
 Write a simulation with just this (for in this case, both constructing
 the test and making measurements is easy).
 (3) Define some equivalent sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A},\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}',\left|\psi'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 s.t.
 the result of measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A},\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equivalent to measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}',\left|\psi'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Then I came back and got stuck at evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $dI$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 Arvind, made quick progress.
 He told me that formally, any

Hermitian
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 operator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

, can be measured by introducing an apparatus and a measurement apparatus
 with the following interaction Hamiltonian (for a short time) 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}=-a\hat{Q}\hat{p}_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 However, I realized that the way I was thinking earlier, was infact a little
 different.
 I was asking if there exists some interaction so that a measurement of
 the particle's position yields the value of the observable 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

 at the earlier time? That I doubt is helpful but anyway.
 Further, I started and finished reading the measurement section of Bohm's
 second paper.
 Figured it was precisely the same as what sir was saying.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Spent quite some time on figuring how to extend the analysis
 done for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

 with a discrete spectrum to that with a continuous spectrum, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}\left|\psi_{q}\right\rangle =q\left|\psi_{q}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Finally figured I was making a mistake, the state corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(y+L)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dy\,\phi(y+L)\left|y\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, and not 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dy\,\psi(y+L)\left|y+L\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (yes it sounds foolish now).
 I was able to show that if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

apparatus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is initially at position 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, with spread 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta y$
\end_inset

, then after measurement, say one obtained 
\begin_inset Formula $y'$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenvalue this will correspond to is 
\begin_inset Formula $q=(1/ta)(y'\pm2\delta y)$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So this essentially means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

 is only required to be Hermitian.
 Then, once we know the complete set of eigenfunctions, we are through.
 I therefore tried evaluating the eigenfunctions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

.
 To get some insight, I started with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 and there itself it got hard.
 One can write it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 or as functions periodic in the position space, with periodicity 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 The difficulty is making them equivalent.
 Showing the latter to be complete anyway won't work for I have constructed
 only two functions (with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

).
 By the time 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}'$
\end_inset

 is used, even 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 ceases to be an eigenstate and I end up with only the position space constraine
d functions.
 So that's a big mess.

[research/ms] Talked to Arvind sir again (yesterday's meeting had gotten
 cancelled).
 Kichoo finally talked about randomness certification etc.
 and it looks rather interesting.
 I think he'll be able to do something new with it.
 I wanted to see if contextuality could be used instead.
 Anyway, coming back to my work, I explained all that I had done yesterday
 to sir.
 He said that we don't need the full spectrum.
 If my state can be expressed a linear combination of the eigenstates I've
 already found, then I'm good to go.
 I can skip the `hard' part.
 He also seemed to have liked the optimization operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Infact, I just realized I told him that I'll explain to him the details
 of the test (perhaps in the next meeting).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Further, I just realized that one can infact 
\emph on
measure non-hermitian operators
\emph default
 also.
 The only requirement will be that (a) the eigenvalue for the some states
 is real and (b) the state being measured is at most a superposition of
 these states.
 This is exciting and I must talk to sir and get this verified.
 Ofcourse the question is then, what happens when you use the same measurement
 scheme (that of measuring non-hermitian operators) to measure a state that
 doesn't satisfy (b)? Looks like that it will fail to satisfy Schr

dinger's equation (the time evolution will become non-unitary), viz.
 probability densities won't be conserved.
 So for now, I must translate this into a simulator problem.
 I was wondering however, if I should use the two degrees of freedom of
 the same particle or should I use two 1-d particles? We'll see.
 Infact, my preliminary feeling is that simulations aren't exactly needed.
 I may have to plot some functions, if at all.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Worked out some more eigenstates (infact arbitrary eigenvalued)
 of the displacement operator.
 Figured how to construct the relevant state by a straight forward generalizatio
n of the GHZ state and my previous work on the Bell Test.
 I am now confused about whether I should try doing the Bell test first,
 or if I should try doing the GHZ test.
 A little exploration reveals that the most interesting (that I can think
 of) method would be to use the Wigner functions for the operators.
 In that spirit, the Bell test is almost trivial (applying the unitaries
 is almost trivial).
 Thereafter, the wigner functions may be evaluated directly.
 Infact, this tells me that if there're really trajectories (as described
 by Bohmian mechanics), then what would be the difference between quantities
 evaluated as averaged for various bohmian trajectories vs.
 evaluated using the Wigner function formalism? Why must negative probabilities
 come into play?
\begin_inset Newline newline

However, the point for me at the moment is that I must start writing the
 simulation.
 For that I need the broadest (in the sense of what the targets that can
 be achieved) and the simplest requirements.

[research/ms] Thought about it at various times.
 What was troubling me was the following: If the GHZ test infact says that
 (q,p) can't be non-contextually deterministic, then how can BM, where (q,p)
 are infact non-contextually deterministic, be consistent with it? There
 are a few things that need to be understood.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

First, note that if a Bohmian particle has position 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

, then the measurement of an `observable' which is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}$
\end_inset

, will infact correspond to the same function, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}$
\end_inset

 replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly for a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 only.
 But here comes the subtlety, if one measures an observable which is an
 arbitrary combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 , eg.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}+\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{H}=\hat{p}^{2}+V(\hat{q})$
\end_inset

, then upon measurement, the value will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be the same function with 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 in place of the operators.
 I must find out if values of all observables are determined completely
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and the initial positions of the particle.
 One quick example that can be thought of is that of a Harmonic oscillator;
 the particle can have essentially arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 but will correspond to the same energy, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is an energy eigenket to start with.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Second, in the GHZ test, the usual structure is that one measures 
\begin_inset Formula $A=X\otimes Y\otimes Y$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 (implicitly defined).
 The contradiction we get essentially hinges on the claim that if 
\begin_inset Formula $X,Y$
\end_inset

 have well defined values, then 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

 should essentially yield a situation identical to measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $X\otimes X\otimes X$
\end_inset

.
 However that needn't be.
 Take for example the non-contextually deterministic theory, BM.
 Within BM, measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will yield values corresponding to the 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 values of the three particles (by corresponding we mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q}\leftrightarrow q,\hat{p}\leftrightarrow p$
\end_inset

).
 However, a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

, will not yield a value that directly corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

, viz.
 it is not a product of values obtained when 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 are separately measured.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Thus in essence, we have shown that it is incorrect to conclude from the
 GHZ argument that determinism (or precisely, a non-contextually deterministic
 description of nature) can't exist.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are ofcourse various aspects which still need exploration.
 (a) One possible approach could be to extend the analysis to full blown
 tests of contextuality, by first appropriately extending them to phase
 space, and then identifying how BM explains them.
 This could either be done in the context of quantum optics (for which BM
 isn't all that popularly known) or for say, the Mermin type argument (the
 Mermin square, for two spin half particles).
 (b) The other direction is to construct an appropriate hidden variable
 model, that is non-contextually deterministic, but still consistent with
 the usual GHZ test.
 The latter should give insight into whether or not the dynamics are essential
 for the analysis, viz.
 recall how a direct extension of the BM principle to discretized space
 gets into trouble (the 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 operator has no analogue); but from the looks of it, a complete analysis
 of the GHZ phase space test would shed some light on it.

) are measured.
 No mixed functions.
 This means that the scheme I worked out the other day, is essentially useless
 for the current purposes.
 Once that's done, then I must work out what measuring

 essentially yields, viz.
 given

 and

[research/ms] Finally discussed things with Arvind sir.
 Explained to him what I had worked out.
 The outcome was that (a) I try to extend the Mermin's proof to phase space,
 (b) Try to simulate the measurement process itself for the GHZ test and
 (c) glance through the paper sir has provided.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It isn't still very clear, how we're so confident that `complicated relation'
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 of the particle and measurement of arbitrary functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{q},\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 are so easily consistent with QM.
 Ofcourse, from the calculation, one will get the eigenvalue corresponding
 to the operator upon measurement, but given 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

, precisely which value one obtains, is not a simple exercise to determine.
 This is where I must use my computational tools.
 Alternatively, sir suggested I look at this paper where a formulation of
 QM is presented, wherein 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 do infact yield the appropriate answers, viz.
 position and momenta are treated symmetrically.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Also, it would be interesting to see how the classical limit can be obtained,
 viz.
 why classically, a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Infact in this sense, perhaps one can see precisely what contextuality
 would mean for classical mechanics.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I was also able to extend the GHZ setup, to that of contextuality (peres
 mermin) rather trivially infact.
 Now the argument becomes even more clear.
 If one imagines that these variables have pre-defined values, then `ofcourse'
 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}=1$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 The flaw again is that determinism or pre-defined values, don't entail
 that you simply multiply the result of observables.
 You must multiply the observables and then ask what is the observed value.
 This readily extends to even the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{KS}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, which BM will happily violate.
 So the claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{KS}\right\rangle \le4$
\end_inset

 for any non-contextual deterministic theory, is wrong; BM is an exception.
 The reason has been delineated earlier.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For my satisfaction though, I'd like to also see how BM is compatible with
 the no-coloring type of proofs of the KS theorem.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In addition, I am unclear about how spins can be handled, as in whether
 spins can be thought of as having predefined value, in the sense just described.
 But wait, don't they? Since like 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,p)$
\end_inset

 by itself doesn't yield upon measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 maybe it does), similarly, spins also have predefined values, dependent
 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $(q,p)$
\end_inset

 and thus compatible with determinism.
 I just found a paper titled ``Spin and non-locality in quantum mechanics'',
 where the spin vector has a pre-defined value.
 Damn it.
 Now I feel that the description of nature is not unique after all.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finding the classical limit, seems like the best way to proceed.
 What would that mean for the KS inequality? What about Bell's inequality?
 Also, did non-locality have anything specific to contribute to this argument?
 Was non-locality necessary? These questions still need to be worked out.

 I realized that while Bell's assumptions about the pre-defined output of

 neglected.
 Thus, one must show that even classically, such an event can happen.
 That classically also, 'contextuality' happens, should be either shown
 or explained why it doesn't.

Wednesday | Jan 27
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] It looks like BM is cheating a little.
 In the sense that it claims that it has a clear classical limit, in which
 the Hamilton Jacobi framework is recovered.
 In this limit, it is said that one needn't worry about measuring the observable
s as being anything special.
 The observables will yield the right values.
 However, for quantum mechanical measurements, the interpretation (or strictly,
 it's author) suggests we use the effective Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{I}=a\hat{p}_{1}\hat{p}_{2}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2$
\end_inset

 labelling the system and the auxiliary particle that will measure the momentum,
 respectively.
 If one tries to find the classical limit of this measurement process, with
 the hope that the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{1}$
\end_inset

 will infact yield 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=\nabla_{1}S$
\end_inset

, one finds a lot of things getting messed up.
 First of all, this interaction adds a term to the continuity equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}+\nabla_{1}\left(P\frac{\nabla_{1}S}{m}\right)+\nabla_{2}\left(P\frac{\nabla_{2}S}{m}\right)+\overbrace{2aR\left[\nabla_{1}R\nabla_{2}S+R\nabla_{1}\nabla_{2}S+\nabla_{2}R\nabla_{1}S\right]}^{\text{Extra Term! | How will}\,P\,\text{satisfy the continuity equation?}}=0
\]

\end_inset

The interaction also adds a ``quantum potential'' in addition to the expected
 potential, which doesn't seem to disappear in the large mass limit.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial t}+\frac{(\nabla_{1}S)^{2}}{2m}+\frac{(\nabla_{2}S)^{2}}{2m}+\overbrace{a\nabla_{1}S\nabla_{2}S}^{\text{expected part}}-\overbrace{a\hbar^{2}\frac{\nabla_{1}\nabla_{2}R}{R}}^{\text{\text{quantum part}}}-\underbrace{\frac{\hbar}{2mR}(\nabla_{1}^{2}R+\nabla_{2}^{2}R)}_{\text{usual quantum potential}}=0
\]

\end_inset

Thus, BM can't do both, have a clear classical limit and be unable to explain
 the measurement process's classical limit.
 Ofcourse all of this is happening primarily because in the usual derivation,
 the author regarded 
\begin_inset Formula $V=V(q_{1},q_{2})$
\end_inset

 and not that of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, this is very unsatisfactory of a theory that in the classical
 limit, things cease to make sense.
 One can yet, see that with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar\to0$
\end_inset

, the quantum potential and the quantum part of the interaction, both disappear.
 However, the continuity equation is not recovered still.
 I may have made some calculation mistakes, which I can check later, but
 at the moment, I must be able to make sense of the notion of measurement
 in the classical setting, even if this particular method needs to be abandoned;
 there must however be cogent reasons for doing so.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Further, it is interesting to note that there're velocity dependent forces
 (non-dicipative) such as Corioli's force that should perhaps result in
 a momentum dependent potential.
 In this case, it would be interesting to see how BM trajectories behave.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Infact, what about galelian invariance? How does that come in the picture
 in BM? Looks like that'll be fine; one only needs to change 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to x-vt$

\begin_inset Formula $v$

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Today I had an interesting thought.
 While I was convinced that there must be something wrong with the following
 argument, the argument seemed to be sound.
 The argument would lead to the conclusion that one can communicate faster
 than light, if Bohmian Mechanics is right.
 So the idea of BM is that since we don't know the initial position of the
 particles precisely, we can't quite make predictions stronger than CM.
 However, consider this.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are two particles, one with person A, and the other with person B.
 Now both measure the position of their particles.
 Thus the positions are precisely known.
 Next, they allow their particles to evolve under a Hamiltonian (interaction)
 such that they become entangled.
 Suppose at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the particles are entangled.
 Now from the de-Broglie theory, both can predict the locations of their
 particles at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Now comes the interesting part.
 The protocol they follow, is as follows.
 Say A uses this setup, only to receive signals.
 If B wants to send a signal to A, all that he needs to do, is to disturb
 his particle at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This would cause some change in, either the wavefunction or the position,
 or both, of the particle, compared to if B had not caused any disturbance.
 Now B measures her particle's position at 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and gets the value 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{B}$
\end_inset

.
 She knows what position her particle should've been at, if B didn't do
 anything, call this position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{B}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 If now 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{B}\neq x_{B}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, then she knows B sent a signal.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{B}=x_{B}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

, then she knows nothing was sent.
 Since the equations are non-local, this interaction is instantaneous, and
 in principle faster than speed of light.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ofcourse, one can fill in the details, which is what I almost started doing,
 but finding the fault in the argument is what was pivotal.
 It turns out, the fault was rather straight forward, although a little
 subtle.
 The idea is that regardless of how precise the position measurement is,
 its uncertainty will spread with the wavefunction, thereby rendering any
 prediction useless.
 Thus, in this light, chaos restores locality.
 This is actually not too hard to see.
 Imagine you have an uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

, when you measured the position and got the value 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Now we can imagine a gaussian associated with this, as the wavefunction,
 after collapse.
 Since the de-Broglie Bohm theory ensures that the probability distribution
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 is preserved by the dynamics of the particles, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 evolves, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 will increase (in case of free evolution), effectively destroying 'position
 information'.
 The idea can only be harnessed, if one can somehow decouple the uncertainty
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 from the wavefunction.
 One possibility I considered was that of very strong ineractions, where
 the wavefunction changes dramatically, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla S$
\end_inset

 doesn't, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 is small, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta q$
\end_inset

 doesn't change much.
 This idea, I don't suppose will work but can be tried.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Another thing one might want to work out, is how a delta function in position
 evolves, according to bohmian mechanics.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Today was rather interesting.
 I read through the paper by Roy and Singh, which talked about a symmetric
 treatment of position and momentum in a causal theory of QM.
 I even started reading the sequal where they show how this maybe extended
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 particles.
 I haven't completely read it.
 I have the following questions though.
 First of all, since 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 are now precisely what they'll turn out to be if measured, then that makes
 a lot of the things I was working on rather simple.
 I can now go ahead and try to answer my question, viz.
 what happens to contextuality in the classical limit? I ask this for it
 looks rather binary to me, unlike the uncertainty principles.
 Next I can ask, what meaning does parity have, in this new causal mechanics.
 I feel it would be now great to attempt the GHZ test and the Peres Mermin
 test.
 Another thing that surprises me is that how can the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 be conserved by the particles, if they don't follow the de-broglie equation,
 which was just the probability current? I would like to simulate both and
 see how they differ.
 Ofcourse, various details of the theory need to be worked out, for the
 functions required, don't seem so straight forward for being numerically
 solved.
 I also think that using the optimized variables I had defined, to further
 extend the Bell test would be rather interesting.
 It is worth noting that the issue with the classical limit of measuring
 momentum disappears here, as the question doesn't arise, although I would
 like to see the same happen with BM.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

On the larger scale, until the QM & BM stage, I was convinced that BM is
 perhaps a more detailed description, which when averaged, yields the right
 QM description.
 However, I am now confused again.
 With the RS (Roy Singh) description, I am unclear about which description
 is correct, or to be precise, I am unclear about the notion that nature
 has a unique description.
 Which seems to suggest that we have hit a stage where in the accuracy of
 our description of nature, can only be tested to a certain level (and its
 not about lack of technology), beyond which, atleast at the moment, it
 appears it is impossible to tell which is right.
 Looks like a rather important lesson for Quantum Gravity.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another thing I thought of, was that of constructing a test which didn't
 have the shortcomings of the Bell & Contextuality test, wherein the possibility
 of change happening due to measurements, is not considered.
 This earlier was rather important because of two reasons.
 (1) In BM itself, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 depends on the measurement but more importantly (2) that measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and getting a value 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 getting a value 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 doesn't entail that measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 would yield the value 
\begin_inset Formula $ab$
\end_inset

.
 The idea I was raising was that while Bell's test is robust under allowing
 `measurements' to modify values, tests of Contextuality are not.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ok so something is still wrong.
 I thought somebody had proven that one can't have all possible sets of
 commuting variables, have a probability distribution, due to `contextuality'.
 But if what I understood is right, then according to BM, all outcomes are
 deterministic.
 So where's the catch? BM just sods it off by saying that the initial conditions
 include the initial position/momentum of the particle and therefore it
 is not included the type of theories considered by `contextuality' like
 proofs.
 I then ask, that in the RS theory, clearly momentum doesn't require anymore
 knowledgeof the particle, than does a position measurement (both of them
 don't that is).
 Thus, it is natural to ask, what properties of the system, can be assumed
 to have a value, independent of measurement (I don't mean lack of determinism,
 I mean it doesn't depend on the initial conditions of the apparatus)? Can
 we construct a theory, wherein all observables have well defined values,
 regardless? I know it won't conflict with, atleast the Peres Mermin type
 arguments, simply because there we run into the 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 type of confusion.
 Antithetically though, the RS paper seemed to claim that such a description
 may not be possible.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One more question that can be addressed is, how to construct an `almost'
 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(N)$
\end_inset

 algebra, out of 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q$
\end_inset

.
 We have already shown how to construct the 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

 structure (which was also already known).
 This is interesting, for then one can use contextuality in a single particle.
 This would then strongly challenge the view (proof?) that non-locality
 is a special case of contextuality.
 If I can simply construct a contextuality test in phase space, using a
 single particle, then I think I'd be done.
 But interestingly, I now recall, Ali had done something similar.
 He used, instead of displacement operators in one direction and the other
 direction specifically, a combination of displacements in the two directions
 and used the geometric phase to his advantage.
 So even though his operators were those used for quantum optics (for quadrature
) and not quite position and momentum, the analogues to exist.
 Which means that at once, it can be shown that contextuality and non-locality
 are different.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Now, non-locality as we showed earlier, can be shown to disappear (atleast
 partly), using chaos.
 However, how does one show Bell like non-locality? Or if one can show why
 we must have a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 as maximum violation.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] I realized today that the contextuality test is constructed
 in a slightly more interesting way.
 They don't just say that 
\begin_inset Formula $AB\to ab$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\to a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B\to b$
\end_inset

.
 They say that if 
\begin_inset Formula $[A,B]=0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $f(A,B)\to f(a,b)$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\to a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B\to b$
\end_inset

.
 So I basically wanted to go against this.
 Obviously, if one starts with a system in the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a,b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then it will follow.
 However, it is possible to find an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

, which is neither an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 nor an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 This calculation was done (fine, using online mathematica like stuff) on
 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $AB=-\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Obviously, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is not an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 (nor of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

).
 Thus measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 will always correspond to the same value, 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, however my theory can assign 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

.
 Thereby violating the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $AB\to ab$
\end_inset

.
 Ofcourse these guys don't even consider issues related to disturbing the
 system after measurement, but that maybe partly justified as all 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,AB$
\end_inset

 commute.
 This was an interesting realization and result, as far as my understanding
 is concerned.
 TODO: write the details.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] One possibility is to construct a test (to test memory, which
 is `required' for any contextual theory) where, alright.
 First imagine that we have commuting observables given by 
\begin_inset Formula $[A_{ij},A_{ik}]=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[A_{ji},A_{ki}]=0$
\end_inset

.
 So for a non-invasive system that remembers what I measured before, I measure
 these in the said order 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{11},\,A_{12},\,A_{13}$
\end_inset

 and then take another identical copy, measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{33},A_{23},A_{13}$
\end_inset

 and compare the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{13}$
\end_inset

.
 If the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{13}$
\end_inset

 is different, then I know that my non-invasive system is contextual.
 Note that non-invasiveness is important, else we can't say if the system
 is contextual or if post measurement, the system obtains a new assignment.
 It will be more tricky to construct such tests for invasive systems.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Ofcourse one can generalize this to finding if assignment of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is contextual by measuring it in the two different contexts, and to varying
 amounts.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To find values which don't have any context, we may choose to measure along
 parallel diagonals.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To get some handle on non-invasive systems, let's imagine that if say a
 measurement is 
\emph on
unfaithful
\emph default
, (viz.
 if a repeated measurement of some observable 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{11}$
\end_inset

, on identically prepared system, yields different values, with certain
 probabilities) then we can imagine certain hidden variables, which are
 not in our control, are causing the variance.
 As an approximation, we assume that whenever these measurements yield the
 same result, the system has the same underlying hidden variables.
 It may happen that after measuring one 
\emph on
unfaithful
\emph default
 operator on two systems, we find the hidden variables are approximately
 the same, then upon subsequent measurement of the next 
\emph on
unfaithful
\emph default
 operator, one might discover that the value obtained for the two systems
 is different.
 In this case, one learns that the system didn't infact have the same hidden
 variables.
 If one does obtain the same value, then again one continues to assume that
 the underlying hidden variables are the same.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This construction maybe completely irrelevant though, since we would like
 to compare systems with identical hidden variables to start with, and then
 make 
\emph on
different
\emph default
 measurements.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To make some progress, I can imagine a black box, which takes in two states,
 and tells me if they are identical (including the hidden variables).
 I don't still learn what those hidden variables are, just that two systems
 are identical.
 (TODO: ensure this is correct).
 Ofcourse, in the final test, I don't want invokation to any such box, but
 to start, let's see if I can proceed assuming such a box exists.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It turns out, there're various smaller, more tractable issues that need
 resolution.
 (a) Consider a theory that assigns values to the peres mermin observables.
 Now upon each measurement, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{33}$
\end_inset

 is assigned a new value (
\begin_inset Formula $1\to-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-1\to1$
\end_inset

).
 | Now is (a) contextual? Is it multiplicative? [Our target is to construct
 by hand, a non-contextual hidden variable theory, that can violate the
 KCBS inequality.] (a) is clearly not multiplicative.
 If I measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{11}A_{33}$
\end_inset

 in a single shot, I will get an answer which will be different from measuring
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{11}$
\end_inset

 and then measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{33}$
\end_inset

 and taking the product 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{11}a_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 Infact, my theory doesn't explicitly tell me the assignment for 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{11}A_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 [What happened to measuring compatible observables together? What role
 does that play? Will contextuality handle that aspect?]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One approach I can follow is, to take the most obvious, non-contextual multiplic
ative hidden variable assignment and then make a small change in that (like
 I just did).
 Then investigate which property has changed, among non-contextuality and
 multiplicativity.
 Note that in doing so, definitions of contextuality and multiplicativity
 will need to be refined.
 So start with some definitions, and as you refine, show why the alternatives
 don't make enough sense (or how they trivialize things).
 Proceed iteratively, to an assignment, that is non-contextual and yet violates
 the KCBS inequality.
 If you're able to retain multiplicativity, great.
 If not, that's also alright.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Also, one must add a boolean property, 
\emph on
efficacy
\emph default
.
 This would be true, if the model is s.t.
 sequential measurement of commuting observables, behave as faithful observables
, viz.
 their values don't change.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I infact realized, that one might think that multiplicativity and commutativity
 are the same thing.
 But surprisingly, this is not so.
 It looks like, in our analysis, we'll end up showing that a violation of
 the KCBS inequality implies that nature is either contextual, or non-multiplica
tive or both.
 From the perspective of BM, nature is non-contextual, but multiplicative.
 Perhaps in other HV models of QM, nature can be made multplicative but
 contextual.
 However, we can't have a HV model that is non-contextual and multiplicative,
 which consistently describes nature.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The outstanding challenge now is, first of all, write all of these things
 systematically with proper examples constructed (as suggested in the approach
 above).
 And second, try to construct a new test, which can distinguish between
 multiplicativity and contextuality.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I have a feeling that all of this has something to do with the maximal set
 of commuting operators.
 This property is rather strange.

[research/ms] Figured two interesting things today.
 First, one can start with assuming that theories are non-invasive, which
 means that they admit measurement schemes which are non-invasive; viz.
 measurements can be made without disturbing the system.
 With this, one can construct two sets of theories.
 Each has only one non-classical feature, one is contextual and the other
 non-multiplicative.
 With these, one can construct the non-imaginative, but standard (that's
 why non-imaginative) Peres Mermin situation.
 Describe the two variants of the KCBS test.
 Variant one will be violated by both, contextual and non-multiplicative
 theories.
 However, variant two will be violated only by the contextual theory.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The other interesting thing I figured, was that while a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}+\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 doesn't mean that the result will be 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b$
\end_inset

, (where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the value obtained upon measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 separately, and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

), however, according to QM, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{A}+\hat{B}\right\rangle =\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle +\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Thus, on an average, measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}+\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 will be the same as measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 separately, average separately, and add.
 Note how the experiments are entirely different.
 This may prove pivotal in two ways.
 First, this shows how QM distinguishes between addition and multiplication
 of observables, quite explicitly.
 Second, this will help in extending the aforesaid scenario, even when we
 give up non-invasiveness.
 Then we will be able to show if QM is truly contextual or not.
 Ofcourse, one also needs to see this in the light of the assumption that
 
\begin_inset Formula $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=0$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Further, I need to see if the 
\emph on
multiplicity
\emph default
 argument holds for addition also, viz.
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=0$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\to a$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\to b$
\end_inset

, then does require 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}+\hat{B}\to a+b$
\end_inset

? This is certainly required on an average, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{A}+\hat{B}\right\rangle =\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle +\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, unlike multiplication, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{A}\hat{B}\right\rangle \neq\left\langle \hat{A}\right\rangle \left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The commutativity argument doesn't figure here, since we're talking about
 compatible observables.

[research/ms] Finished writing the main ideas in the draft.
 They look interesting.
 So the final argument goes as follows.
 A multiplicative theory will yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{\text{KCBS}}\right\rangle =\left\langle \chi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 For simplistic `deterministic' theories, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{\text{KCBS}}\right\rangle =\left\langle \chi_{2}\right\rangle \le4$
\end_inset

.
 A theory that violates the KCBS but not 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{2}$
\end_inset

, is certainly non-classical in some way, but must be non-multiplicative.
 As we have demonstrated (to do), for QM, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{\text{KCBS}}\right\rangle \ne\left\langle \chi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 in general, thus predictions of QM can't be explained by any theory that
 is multiplicative.
 More specifically, we have ruled out contextual theories, which are multiplicat
ive, as candidates for describing the quantum world.
 These theories are usually believed to be the appropriate alternative candidate
s to simplistic `deterministic' theories.
 
\emph on
In fact, one can remove contextuality completely from the picture;
\emph default
 there exist formulations of quantum mechanics in terms of hidden variables,
 which are non-contextual and non-multiplicative.
 They are consistent with all predictions of QM, including violation of
 the KCBS inequality.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I need to work on the following.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(1) Not that the progress so far is particularly depressing, but it would
 be great if I could somehow construct a true test of contextuality.
 Also, I would imagine that one can construct a better test of multiplicativity.
 I think I should try to focus on this independent of contextuality.
 On specific states, it is easy to show.
 I must aim at constructing a state independent test.
 But as usual, let me start with state dependent ones and see what progress
 I can make.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(2) I should either show this analytically, or numerically, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \chi_{\text{KCBS}}\right\rangle \neq\left\langle \chi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Infact, if I can show this for even one state, it is enough to show that
 QM is not multiplicative.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Constructed an incorrect `proof' of contextuality in 2 dimensions!
 Was convinced it is correct to start with and then found the flaw.
 Started working on a test of multiplicativity, independent of that of contextua
lity.
 Initially I felt I was just trying to come up with some operator identity
 that numbers won't satisfy.
 This again became an orthodox contextuality like test.
 I realized later that the test for multiplicativity is actually quite different
 in spirit.
 So I started with constructing a state dependent test.
 In general, one can write the simplest test as follows.
 Consider two observables 
\begin_inset Formula $A,\,B$
\end_inset

, s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[A,B]=0$
\end_inset

.
 For a multiplicative theory, 
\begin_inset Formula $m(AB)-m(A)m(B)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This also entails that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m(AB)\right\rangle -\left\langle m(A)m(B)\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

.
 If I can show that there exists some state for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m_{1}(A)m_{2}(B)\right\rangle -\left\langle m(AB)\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

, then I'm through.
 Ofcourse, it is also possible that on an average, the equality holds, but
 there exist special events where it is violated.
 One can consider those, but a more robust and experiment friendly method
 would be to find some averaged expression.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Some possible directions for explicit examples include: Choose 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\hat{p}a}e^{i\hat{q}b}=e^{i\hat{q}b}e^{i\hat{p}a}$
\end_inset

, basically so that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=e^{i\hat{p}a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}=e^{i\hat{q}b}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $[\hat{A},\hat{B}]=0$
\end_inset

.
 Now, one needs to cook up the right state to see if a violation can be
 arrived at.
 Further, one can use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|11\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 state, with 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 This would be a 2 qubit example.
 Finally, for a two qubit case, perhaps using 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}=\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right|$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}=\left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right|$
\end_inset

 on a superposition 
\begin_inset Formula $(\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 would make most sense.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I also thought of how this maybe extended to addition.
 For instance, measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $O=A+B$
\end_inset

, will always be s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle O\right\rangle =\left\langle A\right\rangle +\left\langle B\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, according to QM.
 According to a multiplicative theory, 
\begin_inset Formula $m(O)=m_{1}(A)+m_{2}(B)$
\end_inset

, where the order is not important.
 Upon averaging, we will get 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle m(O)\right\rangle =\left\langle m(A)+m(B)\right\rangle =\left\langle m(A)\right\rangle +\left\langle m(B)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, I will see no violation, on an average.
 A suggested modification is to define 
\begin_inset Formula $C:=AB$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $O=CB^{-1}+A^{-1}C$
\end_inset

.
 Now perhaps a sequential can be done on the latter two and a violation
 arrived at.
 This however, seems to not be as neat as I'd like (even if it works that
 is).

What can be said about non-locality, it's relation to contextuality; what
 about Bell's test? Does that have anything to do with multiplicativity?
 What about all the beautiful properties such as monogamy associated with
 the Bell test and Contextuality? Where do these things stand in this new
 perspective? I have a feeling that something rather interesting is in store
 for us.
\begin_inset Newline newline

After trying to construct an explicit test for multiplicativity, I realized
 that QM doesn't infact violate it.
 In essence, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Now one can verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|[++]\right\rangle =(-i\left|00\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|[+-]\right\rangle =(-i\left|01\right\rangle +\left|10\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left|[-+]\right\rangle =(i\left|01\right\rangle +\left|10\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|[--]\right\rangle =(i\left|00\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 are eigenkets of

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\pm,\pm$

 Now for the state, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|11\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, we know that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $AB=\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 would yield the value 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 Infact, 
\begin_inset Formula $AB\left|11\right\rangle =\left|11\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 However, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|11\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is neither an eigenket of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, nor an eigenket of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, a measurement of either will collapse the state to some other state.
 A measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 would leave the state invariant.
 This seemed to suggest that perhaps, this setup can be used to establish
 non-multiplicativity of QM.
 That isn't however the case.
 This is so because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|11\right\rangle =(\left|[++]\right\rangle +\left|[--]\right\rangle )/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now if 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 is measured, we're guaranteed to get 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 However, if we measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 first, then we'd get either 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 Say we got 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 The state would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|[++]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and thus measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 would always yield 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, a measurement for 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 and similarly for measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 first.
 Thus, even though the physical situations are completely different, 
\begin_inset Formula $m(AB)=m(A)m(B)$
\end_inset

.
 This completely undermines the argument I was trying to build against contextua
lity.
 Looks like QM is afterall multiplicative, although I haven't exactly proven
 this.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] There're atleast two interesting directions to pursue at this
 stage.
 One is that I try to see what exactly happens for 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $[A,B]=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $[A,C]=0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $[B,C]\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The other is that I try to construct the simulator for BM and see precisely
 how these values change upon being measured.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The latter will take quite some time and be useful as a tool in general.
 I also realized that if one is allowed to update values, then one can violate
 the KCBS inequality, without caring for which compatible observable was
 measured before/with.
 So then in my old notation, non-multiplicativity will arise in the sense
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(A)m_{1}(B)\neq m(AB)$
\end_inset

 in general.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(A)m_{2}(B)=m(AB)$
\end_inset

.
 This I suspect will also hold for BM.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

From tomorrow, I will start working on the simulator.
 I want that table.
 Then I'll construct the theory.
 Should have `experimental' results before attempting construction of a
 theory (don't have very solid principles guiding my theory now do I?).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For the moment, consider the situation where we start with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 and we measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 The system will yield the value 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(A_{33})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Now the system checks if it is consistent with 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{3}=1$
\end_inset

, corresponding ofcourse to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{33}$
\end_inset

.
 It updates the values to be consistent, say to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & -1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

Now if I measure say 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{23}$
\end_inset

, I will get 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}(A_{23})=-1$
\end_inset

.
 The system checks if 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}=-1$
\end_inset

, which is true and if 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{2}=1$
\end_inset

, which isn't, and thus, updates the system state to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
-1 & -1 & -1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right].
\]

\end_inset

Finally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{13}$
\end_inset

 is measured, I get 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{3}(A_{13})=1$
\end_inset

.
 The requirements 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 are satisfied, so no changes are required.
 Ofcourse, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(A_{33})m_{2}(A_{23})m_{3}(A_{13})=-1$
\end_inset

 as required.
 Note that in principle, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}(A_{33})m_{1}(A_{23})m_{1}(A_{13})=1\neq-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the theory is not `counterfactually multiplicative' but is `sequentially
 multiplicative'.
 *Since the former can't quite be `tested', we must conclude that Bohmian
 Mechanics is atmost as speculative, as is contextuality.* 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It is also true, that the memory model was not `counterfactually multiplicative'
 but was `sequentially multiplicative'.
 The point is that beyond this stage, since both models require the possibility
 of updating the internal state after a measurement is made, it is simpler
 to just update all commuting variables, rather than making the model `contextua
l'.
 Contextuality in this light, is not a necessity, but merely a possibility.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Further, one can almost show that QM is multiplicative.
 Consider two operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}=\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $AB\left|\psi\right\rangle =\lambda\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 For simplicity, assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

.
 We now show that the most general 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be written as a superposition of those simultaneous eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, that satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $ab=\lambda=1$
\end_inset

.
 Let us start with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|[00]\right\rangle +\beta\left|[01]\right\rangle +\gamma\left|[10]\right\rangle +\delta\left|[11]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|[**]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 represent eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

; 
\begin_inset Formula $A\left|[01]\right\rangle =\left|[01]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left|[10]\right\rangle =1\left|[10]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for example.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|[00]\right\rangle +\beta\left|[01]\right\rangle -\gamma\left|[10]\right\rangle -\delta\left|[11]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\hat{A}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\alpha\left|[00]\right\rangle -\beta\left|[01]\right\rangle -\gamma\left|[10]\right\rangle +\delta\left|[11]\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Comparing this to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=-\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dots$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta,\gamma=0$
\end_inset

.
 This proves that the most general 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be written as a superposition of kets s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $ab=1$
\end_inset

.
 Multiplicativity directly follows from this, as any measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 individually, will collapse the state into one of the simultaneous eigenkets
 (or their superposition, depending on the degenerecy).

 they commute, and 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC=1$
\end_inset

, like the PM setup, then in the measurement process, wouldn't 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}.\hat{p}_{2}}=e^{-i\hat{p}_{2}}=e^{i\hat{A}\hat{p}_{2}}e^{i\hat{B}\hat{p}_{2}}e^{i\hat{C}\hat{p}_{2}}$
\end_inset

 Working now on figuring out how to write the simulator.
 I think it will be more clear if I implement the `theoretical measurement'
 scheme, as opposed to working on the magnetic field gradient based approach.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It looks like it maybe worth studying Page 158, Spins of Bohmian Mechanics
 by Detlef.
 Understood how in BM, one can't ascribe spin to a particle.
 The argument is simple but it entails that given identical initial conditions
 (including the hidden variable, viz position), the outcome of a measurement
 is not fixed.
 One must also feed the experimental setup.
 For example, if one reverses the magnetic field gradient, the spin of the
 particle would turn out to be 
\begin_inset Formula $-1/2$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $+1/2$
\end_inset

 for the exact same initial condition.
 See the book for details.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The interesting part for my work was that one can use simple arguments,
 like the ones used in the book, to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 however is a little complicated.
 Either one must turn the particle (which complicates the shape of the gaussian
 packet, viz.
 it must be analyzed carefully) or think of the particle beam splitting,
 along its very direction of propagation; neither are neat.

[research/ms] Took an interesting step forward today.
 Extended the GHZ test itself, to a full blown test of contextuality.
 The details, I'll type later, but see [
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The advantage is that I need only measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

 (no 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

), so that simplifies things a lot.
 In addition, it looks like we (fine I) were (was) spot on about the kind
 of theories.
 We will now be able to show how BM is `onotologically non-multiplicative'
 but non-contextual.
 However, it is `sequentially multiplicative', as required by QM (which
 we proved a few days ago).
 So in essence, we would've clarified that while `ontologial multiplicativity'
 is as much a philosophical speculation (since it can't be tested at present)
 as is contextuality.
 Confusing different measurement settings that yield different answers for
 the same initial conditions, doesn't explain `contextuality'.

[research/ms] Thought about how one can even do generalized measurements,
 and yield analytic results by assuming that the measuring particle is at
 a particular location.
 The idea is infact quite simple.
 The wavefunction of the measuring particle gets split, depending the state
 of the `system'.
 After splitting of this wavefunction, in which constituent `wavefunction'
 the measuring particle will sit, will depend, by the same token as the
 Stern Gerlach analysis, on the initial position of the measuring particle.
 Effectively then, if the measuring particle is assumed to be at the top
 most position, it would follow that the eigenstate (of the observable that
 we intend to measure) with the most negative eigenvalue, will be the outcome.

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Figured how to prove sequential multiplicativity in QM.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}(\hat{O})$
\end_inset

 refer to the outcome of measuring an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 parametrizes the sequence of the measurement.
 Sequential multiplicativity is the statement that 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\hat{P})=m_{1}(\hat{P}_{1})m_{2}(\hat{P}_{2})=m_{1}(\hat{P}_{2})m_{2}(\hat{P}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 The proof is simple.
 Consider a set of compatible operators, which are also complete.
 For simplicity, let's say the set is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\{\hat{P}_{1},\hat{P}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 (not anti-commutation, its a set).
 Now consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}=\hat{P}_{1}+\hat{P}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 be s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\left|\psi\right\rangle =p\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\nexists$
\end_inset

 any 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{i}\left|\psi\right\rangle =\lambda_{i}\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (else the result we're trying to prove will be trivial; as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is a simultaneous eigenket of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}p_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 If you're uncomfortable with this `claim' or its relevance, one can use
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}=\sigma_{x}\otimes\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}=\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|00\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 makes for a non-trivial 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Coming to the proof, first we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{i}\left|p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle =p_{i}\left|p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

note that it suffices for me to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 must be a superposition of only those simultaneous eigenkets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}p_{2}=p$
\end_inset

.
 This can be proved as follows.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{aligned} & \hat{P}\left|\psi\right\rangle  & = & p\left|\psi\right\rangle \\
\implies\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}\right|\hat{P}\left|\psi\right\rangle  & =p_{1}p_{2}\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}|\psi\right\rangle  & = & p\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}|\psi\right\rangle .
\end{aligned}
\]

\end_inset

It follows immediately, that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}|\psi\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

, then it entails that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as an eigenket in its superposition, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}p_{2}=p$
\end_inset

.
 However, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}|\psi\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

, then we won't ever see 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 as outcomes, so it is irrelevant.
 That then completes the proof.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This can be readily generalized to any number of operators, even if they're
 not complete (in which case the remaining operators maybe added to complete
 the set, but the eigenvalues corresponding to them, don't play any role
 in the proof, and thus making its extension trivial).

 I started with trying to arrive at precise assignments using the

 It was taking a lot of effort.
 Finally realized that I can just abstract out the Bohmain Mechanics by

 Explained it to Kishor and he seemed to have been convinced (atleast distracted

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Discussed the developments so far with Prof.
 Arvind.
 He seemed perplexed about the contextual assignment of values.
 Did seem finally convinced.
 However, towards the end he made a remark that we shouldn't start with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1
\end{array}$
\end_inset

.
 This I should clarify with him, that this assignment is necessary for predictin
g values for the first time and hence not optional.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\emph on
first interesting
\emph default
 thing that sir had pointed out, in context of multiplicativity, was that
 one can measure a super operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 that can, in a single shot, measure all `compatible' operators.
 His point was that then I know the values all these operators had, and
 thus the assignment must be consistent, even `ontologically'.
 However, that isn't true.
 We can show this by the following simple example.
 Consider the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\left|000\right\rangle +\left|011\right\rangle +\left|101\right\rangle +\left|110\right\rangle \right)/2$
\end_inset

.
 Let the computational basis be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|i\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is the decimal of the binary equivalent.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 be a super operator, given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}=i\left|i\right\rangle \left\langle i\right|$
\end_inset

, which is just a diagonal matrix.
 Now a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 will yield either 0, 3, 5 or 6.
 Now consider the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{1}=\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z},\,\hat{B}_{2}=\mathbb{I}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{3}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

.
 In this example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}=\hat{B}_{1}\hat{B}_{2}\hat{B}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Now if I measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

, I will always get a +1, and the state will never collapse.
 However, if I measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

, I may get a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 independently.
 A measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 will yield one of the values as stated, which would uniquely determine
 the values one gets for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 has been measured, viz.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are measured thereafter, they will agree with the values one would deduce
 from the outcome of measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

.
 We can't (atleast in no way conceivable presently) contradict (because
 QM is silent on that note) non-multiplicativity.
 I know this needs to be written properly, but the idea is roughly there.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\emph on
second interesting
\emph default
 thing that was raised, was whether the statistics of QM can be matched,
 for all states 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 I was under the impression that the said algorithm will work, but it won't.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\cos\theta\left|00\right\rangle +\sin\theta\left|11\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Obviously a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}\otimes\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 using the coin toss model will fail to get the right statistics.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Other than this, Jaskaran didn't seem convinced of the accuracy of the model.
 He said that the assignments should be state independent, because contextuality
 is a statement about observables, and is state independent (he didn't want
 to bring in state dependence).
 That was one.
 He felt that the model is a sort of simulation of PM situation only and
 wasn't anything different or new.
 He suggested I look at `Contextuality for preparations, tranformations
 and measurements' by Robert Spekkers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wednesday | March 23
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Figured how to fix the statistics in general, again motivated
 by Bohmian Mechanics.
 One could start with choosing a random number 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 (uniformly random).
 Then one finds 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{-}=\left|\left\langle p_{-}|\psi\right\rangle \right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and then assigns 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $c<P_{-}$
\end_inset

, else 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 is assigned.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Further, Jaskaran claims to have found a mistake with my argument.
 Will listen to it, when he's available.

 A hidden-variable perspective

 Now I can't find this on arxiv and therefore can't be certain how different
 it is from my work, but anyway.

\end_layout

 on how contextuality can't really be proven experimentally.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Other than this, spent most of my time, on trying to write the poster.
 Some of the results include 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:researchFlow"

\end_inset

.
 The rough points of the draft have already been made.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, I also figured how one can `complete' quantum mechanics using just
 a single hidden variable and make each operator have a predictable value.
 This sounds particularly interesting in the light of contextuality tests
 etc.
 In addition, I realized one can quickly show how values assigned to operators,
 may still depend on how they're measured; viz.
 the stern gerlach and direct value assigned to the operator can be shown
 to be different, effectively saying that one can't associate spin with
 a particle.
 However, that doesn't give rise to any inconsistency, since the theory
 is non-multiplicative.
 In addition to this, it also appears that one maybe able to turn the argument
 around and show that one can't associate even positions with particles.
 Now that would be seriously interesting and against BM.
 Perhaps then, it would remain how to construct an appropriate Hamiltonian,
 given an observable 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 can be measured using 
\begin_inset Formula $O'$
\end_inset

, some other observable.
 One can also compare trajectories.
 I also seem to remember RS conjecturing the maximal completeness of their
 theory.
 Perhaps this theory is effectively doing that.
 But a little though reveals that in this sense, even BM is maximally complete.
 So I'm guessing I remember the conjecture wrong.
 It also seems that one can show, within this simplistic framework, how
 non-locality and contextuality are related.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In hindsight, it appears to me that even RS were doing something mysteriously
 similar.
 My idea was simply to construct a cumulative probability distribution,
 by ordering the the outcomes based on eigenvalues (of whichever operator)
 and then using this single hidden variable to identify which event will
 happen.
 This is guaranteed to work because cumulatives are monotonic and increasing.
 It also has traces of this problem I thought about a long time ago in Bag's
 course, where I had to convert a uniform random distribution into an arbitrary
 random distribution.

\begin_layout Subsection
Friday | March 25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[research/ms] Various interesting ideas were discussed today.
 Let me start with the one that I had figured yesterday, or atleast appreciated
 properly enough then.
 We want to create a minimalistic hidden variable theory, in which only
 one hidden variable is assumed, and the outcomes of all experiments are
 predicted in the simplest conceivable way.
 Here it is.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

1.
 Initial: You're given 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

; Choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $c\in(0,1)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

2.
 Assignment/Prediction: Given an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, find its eigenkets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\sum_{a}\left\langle a|\psi\right\rangle \left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{a}=\sum_{a'=a_{min}}^{a}\left\langle a'|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The value assigned to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the smallest eigenvalue, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $c\le c_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 (for example, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}=A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos\theta\left|0\right\rangle +\sin\theta\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

 is assigned 0, if 
\begin_inset Formula $c\le\cos^{2}\theta$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

3.
 After measuring, choose a new 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and update 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 using the measurement postulate of QM, consistently with the value assigned
 in step 2.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This has various interesting consequences (there's also an issue with the
 value of the spin operator and stern gerlach based value deduction etc.)
 It is especially interesting to note that this has to be non-multiplicative
 and peculiarities associated with it.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The next interesting thing which was discussed, was observed and raised
 by Bhati.
 He proposed an interesting test to distinguish QM from BM.
 The essence of the idea was that one asks, what are the bounds in time,
 given for photons to arrive, at a given area (say the minima band) on the
 screen.
 He said that since according to BM, only a small set of trajectories (very
 close) should arrive at the screen, their time must be bounded; whereas
 according to the path integral picture, he claimed that this time is not
 bounded.
 This was eventually resolved by using the probability distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(q_{1},q_{2},t)$
\end_inset

 at the initial and final time to note that we will have an arc like set
 of dots (in the contour plot of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, for a later time) and perhaps the Gaussian in it make the time unbounded.
 So that was sorted.
 Interesting questions were raised about how to calculate the time corresponding
 to a path that the electron takes and about the time difference between
 the rays that interfere and their repercussion on single photon experiments.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, Jaskaran downloaded the paper for me.
 It turns out that the paper has a much more elaborate discussion and mine
 seems much more simple and straight forward.
 Also, he told me the issue with my construction; in a line, he said that
 it doesn't yield a joint probability distribution, which he demands mustn't
 change after measurement.

\begin_layout Standard
The following has been taken from an email written to Ali Asadian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
[background] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you know, in the GHZ test, one is able to show that determinism can't
 hold.
 However, this is done using spins.
 How this is handled in Bohmian Mechanics (BM) has been discussed already
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhysRevA.66.052109"

\end_inset

.
 It is not in direct contradiction with BM because spins are not treated
 like (q,p).
 In BM, (q,p) are well defined, just that we can't observe them.
 However, spins in BM are only a property of the wavefunction and not postulated
 to have well defined `values' like (q,p).
 Thus, while it is interesting to see how BM handles being deterministic
 and consistent with GHZ, it's not too surprising to see it work, since
 spins aren't assumed deterministic like (q,p).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
[thesis problem] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Do you recall the GHZ paper that had been extended to continuous variables?
 The point was that this particular approach showed that there can't be
 determinism for (q,p).
 However, BM seems to be an example that does precisely this.
 How can this be? It is precisely this that I intend to explore in my thesis.
 If BM's predictions differ from QM, then we at once have a wonderful test
 to find which theory is correct.
 If the predictions match, as is more likely, we'll be closer to answering
 to atleast two important questions.
 (1) Which extra assumption goes into the GHZ like tests which is unaccounted
 and (2) How contextuality emerges from non-locality, especially in continuous
 variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
[future scope] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ofcourse, a more ambitious goal would be to look at your results 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "PhysRevLett.114.250403"

\end_inset

 on contextuality in continuous variables and use BM to understand the relation
 of non locality with it more directly.
 Perhaps if I have enough time, I'll pursue that as well.
 The one question which I still haven't an answer to is the following: How
 is it that, while formally in QM, spins and (q,p) are handled very similarly,
 why can't we extend BM in a manner to include spins as 'deterministic'
 as are (q,p)? I would like to either find such a formulation or show that
 it doesn't exist.
 This is of great interest for this answer must depend on the fundamental
 difference between spins and (q,p) as properties.
 The thesis problem is a step in this direction.
