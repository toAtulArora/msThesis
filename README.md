I would like to dedicate this thesis to my mother, who introduced me to the most valuable notion, that of freedom, and to my father who fostered it.

Abstract

Abstract The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (QM) asserts that the wavefunction is the most complete description, which entails that there is an inherent fuzziness in our description of nature. There exists a completion of QM, known as Bohmian Mechanics (BM), which replaces this fuzziness with precision, and re-introduces notions of physical trajectories. Various interesting questions arise, solely by existence of such a description; doesn't it contradict the uncertainty principle, for instance. Most of these questions were found to have been addressed satisfactorily in the literature. There was however, one question, whose answer has become the subject of the thesis; that of the paradoxical co-existence of contextuality and BM. In a theory that can predict the value of operators, the value an operator takes, must depend on the state of the system (including hidden variables). Contextuality arguments show that the value an operator takes, must also depend on the complete set of compatible operators, to be consistent with QM. BM being deterministic, is at complete odds with this notion. 

Abstract After various attempts we were able to show, that the notion of contextuality is infact not necessary. This was achieved by identifying another `classical property' and constructing a non-contextual toy-model, serving as a counter-example to the impossibility proof. The toy model has been generalized to a discrete but arbitrarily sized Hilbert space, consistent with all predictions of QM. Implications of violation of this `classical property' have been discussed, in particular, to the notion of non-locality.

Acknowledgements

I acknowledge the contribution of my project guide, Prof. Arvind, who provided me with an environment conducive to research, and motivation to facilitate completion of this project. He encouraged independent thinking and guided me through difficulties I encountered.

Discussions with the Quantum Computation & Quantum Information (QCQI) group members, especially those with Rajendra Bhati and Kishor Bharti have been particularly efficacious. Inputs from Jaskaran Singh have also been helpful. The QCQI group seminars, specifically, those by Samridhi Gambhir and Dr. Arun Shehrawat, have helped narrowing the thesis problem. 

Dr. Abhishek Choudhuri and Prof. Sudeshna Sinha, although formally not related to the project, have been kind enough to assist me at various instances with challenges I faced while numerically simulating the equations. 

I am grateful to my parents and my colleagues/friends, who have been pivotal to helping me maintain mental balance, inspired me and provided emotional support, in ways they perhaps don't realize, specifically Manu Jayadharan, Prashansa Gupta, Kishor Bharti, Ritu Roy Chowdhury, Vivek Sagar, Yosman BapatDhar, Saumya Gupta, Shwetha Srinivasan, Evelyn Abraham and Srijit Mukherjee.

I end with acknowledging Immanuel Kant, for his philosophical work on ethics, which has heavily affected my thoughts, actions and outlook to life.




Here I'll record the progress I make as a go through this final phase :D
The general direction of the project at the moment is along the direction of Bell's Inequality and Continuous Variables. While the work I did during the summers was also along these lines, in this investigation, the approach is slightly different.
