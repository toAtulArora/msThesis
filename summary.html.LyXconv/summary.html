[research/summer] Read Haridichi’s paper about measuring a bounded observable using a two level system<ul>

Implicitly it had used results from POVMs; so had to read about POVMs from Nielsen’s book

Couldn’t still fully understand what Ali was doing, I figured that <span class="formula"><i>A</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">†</sup><sub class="script"><i>i</i></sub></span><i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> type of operators if they satisfy <span class="formula"><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><i>A</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">†</sup><sub class="script"><i>i</i></sub></span><i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <span class="blackboard">I</span></span>, then one can talk about probability of getting the <span class="formula"><i>i</i><sup><i>th</i></sup></span> input as <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>A</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">†</sup><sub class="script"><i>i</i></sub></span><i>A</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>.

However, for projectors, since <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>P</i></span> and if <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sup>†</sup> = <i>P</i></span>, then the condition stated earlier essentially becomes <span class="formula"><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = <span class="blackboard">I</span></span> and that makes sense.

He talks about how in CStat Mech, we use the function <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>)</span> to describe a probability, whereas here we use the less general density <span class="formula"><i>ρ</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>)</span> where the <span class="formula"><i>p</i></span> has been specified.

Tried to look up papers related to Bohmian Mechanics and Contextuality (couldn’t find too many papers related to this)<ul>
<li>
In Quantum Physics without Quantum Philosophy, 3.8.3 talks about contextuality (looks very wordy)

<li>
In Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Theory, page 67 is a chapter on contextuality

</li>
<li>
Can I think of a way of constructing a theory that’s local, but not real? Can reality then be emergent? Does it mean that the moment I say I don’t assume reality, then it must mean that my theory must have some sort of measurement and then it is essentially a combination of worst of both worlds?

The louvielle equation can then be expressed in terms of these spatial variables. Integrating it we get <div class="formula">

</div>
To get the momentum transport equation, after multiplying the louvielle equation with <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> and integrating, we get <div class="formula">
∂<sub><i>t</i></sub>(<i>P</i><span class="overline"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>) + <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">1</span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><i>m</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span><span class="limits"><span class="limit">⎲</span><span class="limit">⎳</span></span>∂<sub><i>x</i><sub><i>j</i></sub></sub>(<i>P</i><span class="overline"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>p</i><sub><i>j</i></sub></span>) + <i>P</i>∂<sub><i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></sub><i>V</i> = 0
</div>
 (apparently integrated by parts and assumed <span class="formula"><i>f</i> → 0</span> as <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> → ∞</span>)<br/>
While <span class="formula"><i>f</i></span> is constant along a phase space trajectory, the spatial density <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> (equivalent of <span class="formula"><i>ρ</i></span>) is not. It’s apparent from the derivation of the continuity equation; either we start with a fixed volume or a fixed number of particles, not both.<br/>
If you substitute <span class="formula"><i>f</i> = <i>ρ</i><i>δ</i>(<i>p</i> − ∇<i>S</i>)</span> as stated earlier, you’d get <span class="formula"><i>P</i> = <i>ρ</i></span>, <span class="formula"><span class="overline"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> = ∂<sub><i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></sub><i>S</i></span>, <span class="formula"><span class="overline"><i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>p</i><sub><i>j</i></sub></span> = ∂<sub><i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></sub><i>S</i>∂<sub><i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></sub><i>S</i></span> as expected.

<li>
Remarks: <ol>
<li>
It’s not obvious that if we start with a state that has well defined momentum (delta distribution) but the positions are given by <span class="formula"><i>ρ</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>, then they will continue to be well defined in momentum. This happens only exceptionally. In general, a pure state maybe sent to a mixed state. We’ll see examples of these. [todo: ensure examples make sense]
</li>
<li>
Can we decompose any mixed ensamble into a linear combination of pure ones? The answer’s no. [proof?] Say there are many solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, given by <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>. Thus, we can construct a linear combination as <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>) = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><i>ρ</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>)<i>δ</i><span class="symbol">(</span><i>p</i> − ∇<i>S</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>x</i>, <i>t</i>)<span class="symbol">)</span></span> where <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> (degenerate notation) refers to the distribution of momenta at a given point. <span class="formula"><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><i>P</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> = 1</span> is assumed for normalization. Claim is that this is not in general possible to decompose a state into this form. An explicit example is that of reflecting through a potential barrier (in CM) [todo: ensure the example works]
</li>
<li>
While this is not particularly useful in CM (the pure and mixed states), the formalism helps in comparison with QM.

Illustration: We see that <span class="formula"><i>f</i><sub>0</sub>(<i>x</i>, <i>p</i>) = <i>δ</i>(<i>x</i> − <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>)<i>δ</i>(<i>p</i> − <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>)</span> remains sharp<br/>
(it can be checked by inserting it in the louviel equation) to yield <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>x</i>, <i>p</i>) = <i>δ</i>(<i>x</i> − <i>x</i>(<i>t</i>, <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>))<i>δ</i>(<i>p</i> − <i>p</i>(<i>t</i>, <i>x</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>))</span> [this is expected, since you’re in essence saying there’s only one particle]

This form of <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub>0</sub></span> has already been solved for and tells us <span class="formula"><i>ρ</i> = <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator"><i>e</i><sup> − (<i>x</i> − <i>vt</i>)<sup>2</sup> ⁄ 2<i>σ</i><sup>2</sup></sup></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2<i>π</i><i>σ</i><sup>2</sup></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>.

[research/ms] Concluded that I’ll just ask sir now for some advice. What I’m doing doesn’t seem to help;<div class="Unindented">
So we start with <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dS</i> = <span class="bigsymbol">∮</span>∇<i>S</i>.<i>dx</i> = <span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>p</i>.<i>dx</i> = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∫</span></span>∇ × <i>p</i>.<i>da</i></span>. If <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dS</i> = <i>nh</i></span>, then we must have <span class="formula">∇ × <i>p</i> = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><sub><i>a</i></sub>Γ<sub><i>a</i></sub><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∫</span></span><sub><i>γ</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></sub><i>δ</i>(<i>x</i> − <i>x</i><sub><i>a</i></sub>)<i>dx</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span> where <span class="formula"><i>γ</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span> is the nodal line. If we assume <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dS</i> = <i>nh</i></span> holds, then can we construct some example of the same? Let’s first see how <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dS</i> = <i>nh</i></span> can be derived. If the only condition is that <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> is single valued, then we know that at any point, <span class="formula"><i>S</i>’</span> and <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> both yield the same <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span>, where <span class="formula"><i>S</i>’ = <i>S</i> + <i>nh</i></span>. If one considers a loop, then say we start from a point <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>. Then after completing some distance, the change in <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> is given by <span class="formula">Δ<i>S</i></span>. So the value of <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> starting from <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>will be <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> + Δ<i>S</i></span>. Now if we come back to the point <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>, then from uniqueness of <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span>, we only demand <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> + Δ<i>S</i> = <i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> + <i>nh</i></span>. If <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> itself was unique, then we’d say <span class="formula"><i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> + Δ<i>S</i> = <i>S</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>. Now at this point itself I seem to have trouble. I have tacitly assumed that <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> is single valued when I’m evaluating the ‘change is <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span>’ along the curve.

Talked to manu for a while and made some progress, then figured it was non-sense and made some more progress. Finally, Manu found a document that helped clarify a few things. The issue was still that they had used a vector field and not a potential. And it wasn’t clear to me what potential must I use in that case.

[research/ms] Finally found a potential that works (looked at acheson, griffiths and an extra document that manu had found.)<div class="Unindented">
The potential is <span class="formula"><i>V</i> = <i>k</i><i>θ</i></span>. Note how this is itself, as a function of position is multi valued and yet we never have any issues integrating this (as we’ll see shortly). While <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span> is multivalued, <span class="formula">∇<i>V</i> = <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator"><i>k</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><i>r</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span><i>θ̂</i></span> is happily single valued :) And not just that, check this; <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><sub><i>γ</i></sub>∇<i>V</i>.<i>dx</i> = 2<i>π</i></span> (simply because <span class="formula"><i>γ</i></span> is chosen to be a circle and then <span class="formula"><i>dx</i> = <i>rd</i><i>θ</i><i>θ̂</i></span>). Since in the domain of interest, everything is well defined, I can write <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><sub><i>γ</i></sub>∇<i>V</i>.<i>dx</i> = <span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><sub><i>γ</i></sub><i>dV</i> = 2<i>π</i></span>. And one can show independently (I know only a simple minded proof with discritizing the function) that <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dV</i> = 0</span> whenever <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span> is single valued (or a function). So what does this example show? Various rather peculiar things. (I) that <span class="formula"><span class="bigsymbol">∮</span><i>dV</i></span> maybe non zero for a reasonable physical situation by virtue of multivaluedness of <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span>. Yes, <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span> is multivalued and yet we can integrate the said expression without ambiguity. (II) that there happens to be a singularity within the loop, over which the integral is non-zero. (III) The curl, <span class="formula">∇ × ∇<i>V</i> ≠ 0</span> at the center and <span class="formula"> = 0</span> else.<br/>
Now we’ve made plausible various things which would’ve seemed arbitrary otherwise.

[research/ms] Worked out an explicit example of <span class="formula">∇ × <i>p</i> = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><sub><i>a</i></sub>Γ<sub><i>a</i></sub><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∫</span></span><sub><i>L</i><sup>(<i>a</i>)</sup></sub><i>δ</i>(<b>x</b> − <b>x</b><sup>(<i>a</i>)</sup>)<i>d</i><b>x</b><sup>(<i>a</i>)</sup></span> by assuming that the <span class="formula"><i>d</i><b>x</b><sup>(<i>a</i>)</sup></span> term is infact a vector and <span class="formula"><i>d</i><b>a</b></span> is essentially <span class="formula"><b>n</b><i>dxdy</i></span> to see that everything fits well eventually. Then I moved to the next section and everything seemed alright. Basically the discussion of the ’quantum potential term’, viz. the term which if removed would reduce the expression to a classical hamilton jacobi equation, was slightly confusing. This term is given by <span class="formula"><i>Q</i>: =  − (ℏ<sup>2</sup> ⁄ 2<i>m</i>)∇<sup>2</sup><i>R</i> ⁄ <i>R</i></span>, and yet the claim is that this essentially depends on <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span>. The same can be said of <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span> which depends on <span class="formula"><i>x</i>(<i>t</i>)</span> which in turn can be determined only once <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> is specified (NB: <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span> contains information about both the Hamiltonian and the momenta of the system). So in this sense, both <span class="formula"><i>V</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Q</i></span> depend on <span class="formula"><i>S</i></span>. However, the distinction seems to be made on the following ground: if <span class="formula"><i>V</i> = <i>V</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> then, <span class="formula">∇<i>S</i></span> is sufficient. However, for <span class="formula"><i>Q</i></span> it seems higher derivatives will also be necessary. Why this makes any difference, I am yet to learn.

[research/summer] started the process of submission to PRA. Figured how to change the name from Dr. to without Dr. and then am waiting for Ali; he has to tell me if I should use the arXiv link or not. Made reasonable progress at putting things up online. The main trouble was that I wasn’t able to add references. Figured there was a command ’\nocite{*}’ that had to be inserted to fix things. Did that. In addition, I had to change the split images into a single image; else the system kept yielding errors. After that, I had to follow some minor steps but then I got a response from Otfried. He had completed proof reading the pre-print and had made several comments which had to be accommodated.

[research/ms] :( Didn’t do much but thought of the following. Why can’t I think of a bohmian like picture, after a particle has been created for instance, according to QFT. Perhaps I should start playing with the scalar field theory and try to see how I can get bohmian trajectories into them somehow. I suppose the eventual goal would be to think of an alternate interpretation to the field interpretition. I feel that there’s some better way of handling these things. What does Hamilton Jacobi translate to? What happens to the Dirac equation? In QFT we treat the dirac equation as a field and create particles off of it. What will we do here?

[research/ms] Was trying to translate bohmian mechanics to the discrete case. Realized there’ll be an issue with the grad operator but then in the case of spins, we never write the kinetic energy term! Then some discussion with Jaskaran got me realize the following rather interesting conflicting statements, at least for spins. (I) QM is non local; Essentially if you assume locality, you can show determinism must exist, using EPR type states. Now one can use Bell’s inequality to show QM is non local. (II) QM is non-deterministic can be shown using contextuality arguments and coloring theorems.; Comment A: Regarding the conclusion of (I), it is weakened by the fact that one can show you in QM, you can’t communicate faster than speed of light. So in this sense the non locality is, well is it there at all?<span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [A] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [A] </span>Infact, one can show that the bell’s inequality can be violated by 2 if the only assumption is no communication. QM does <span class="formula"><span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>. So whatever this non-locality, it is certainly more restrictive than simply enforcing ’relativity’.</span></span> Comment B: Disregard (I) for the moment. Usually in starting a proof for Bell’s theorem, we assume that both locality and determinism hold (whether one can be derived from another is another matter). Thus a violation entails atleast one of the assumptions is wrong. We don’t know which. From (II) it seems therefore that atleast determinism is false.<span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [B] </span>I had been told that in contextuality, certain other assumptions have to be made (of which I’m not certain).</span></span> Comment C: If only (I) were true, then constructing a theory such as Bohmian mechanics may seem strange because then non-locality is explicit, but in some sense more sensible for we don’t need ’observers’ to make sense of what we’re saying. If (II) is true even in continuous variables, then it would seem meaningless to even imagine constructing a theory such as Bohmian Mechanics.<span class="FootOuter"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [C] </span><span class="HoverFoot"><span class="SupFootMarker"> [C] </span>There maybe defenses such as the observables are not really the same as the object’s position/momentum etc. but more on that later</span></span> Conclusion: One needs to come up with either a contextuality test for continuous variables (Ali’s work) or figure how to setup Bohmian Mechanics for discrete variables.

[research/ms] resumed reading Bohm’s paper | Finalized some things: <ul>
<li>
(a) Bohmian Mechanics: (i) Discuss the basic formalism (ii) Discuss how measurements are done (the hardest part to explain) (iii) Explain how a position measurement may not even yield the ‘true’ position (iv) Talk about spins; the stern gerlach in terms of Bohmian mechanics; 
</li>
<li>
(b) Contextuality: describe it; 
</li>
<li>
(c) Ideas worth exploring: (i) Extension to EM fields, not with photon trajectories as the essential target but for (ii) The relation between Bohmian and Contextuality; (iii) How there maybe ontological models s.t. measurement disturbs the values of the hidden variable; this is essentially how they explain spins, or even position/momentum uncertainty etc.; the basic idea then is that how is Bell’s test acceptable? Because the contextuality tests are also built like so and they get away with it by saying that contextuality is about spins, and that is not really ontological. However, now they even have continuous variable contextuality! These need to be phrased clearly.

I guess then this is the starting of particle physics in some sense. But this is still a curious thing, the charge for B field can be in a superposition but the charge for E field can’t be.

[research/ms] Arun delivered the talk. He was insisting on the epistemic view of science. He said two things which are relevant for my work. First was the idea of a reduced density operator and its connection with Bohmian Mechanics. Detlef’s book has discussed this. The next idea which is more directly relevant at the moment is that of the GHZ test. He was happily asserting that there the notion of reality must be given up. It was then obvious for me to use this as the starting point for my project. The continuous version of the GHZ test already exists and it would be fun to see how it works/fails with bohmian mechanics.

<li>
[research/ms] Found an interesting paper that discusses how bohmian mechanics handles Bell, GHZ and more. Infact, finally I figured precisely what it is that I’ll work on. Instead of looking at contextuality per say, I would instead look at the GHZ test generalized to position and momentum. The paper I found could be useful in setting up the system. In essence then I must look at the following: (1) How is measurement generalized in Bohmian Mechanics [detlef’s article should suffice] (2) GHZ test in continuous variables (3) GHZ test in Bohmian mechanics

[research/ms] Idea: Why is it that position/momentum can’t be used to harness, essentially arbitrary quantumness? Why do we rely on formalism similar to spins for extending to the CV setting?; Next, working on the numerical simulations. It’s going good. About to simulate the schrodinger equation in a very simple case. Then we’ll see the bohmian trajectory for a single particle!; In practice however, I am running into issues with attempting to simulate the schrodinger equation. The point is that <span class="formula"><i>ψ̇</i></span> is needed at arbitrary <span class="formula"><i>q</i></span> and that’s not possible without interpolating <span class="formula">∇<sup>2</sup><i>ψ</i>(<i>q</i>)</span>.<br/>
Since I couldn’t find anyone (surprisingly) to help me with this, I simply interpolate, using Ref <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-1" href="#biblio-1"><span class="bib-index">1</span></a>]</span>. However, I just realized (after having almost written the whole code) that the spline interpolation is for reals, not for complex. I think it can be readily extended, but then I’d have to mess around with spline function! :(

[research/ms] Working on trying to figure why the code’s not working. Now I’m in a situation where I ’print’ an object (of custom type) before sending to a function and then inside that function. They produce different results. WTH! Anyway, trying to figure this. In one attempt found a way to add procedures to types themselves (like a class). Apparently, the proof of concept code works in isolation but is’nt working with my code. Trying to figure that. Man Fortran’s killing me today. So figured that. Here’s the deal: when using procedures within a type, do the following: <div class="listing">
<pre class="listing">type contVar
	integer :: someVariables
	contains      
		procedure, pass :: contVarAllocate
end type contVar
​
contains
subroutine contVarAllocate(this,val)
	class(contVar) :: this
	integer :: val
	this%someVariables=val
end subroutine contVarAllocate
</pre>
</div>
The most important point in all of this is that you’ve to use the keywords <i>class</i> when you’re using the datatype inside a class. The drawback is that doesn’t fix the issue still :( <br/>
Next I tried debugging using dgb. Spent quite some time, only to find that indeed before and after sending the values are different. :( <br/>
Eventually tried writing a code with an allocatable array separately and that apparently does work alright. Alright, <i>figured</i> it. The issue was that the return type of my function was real and the value I intended to return was complex. So for some reason, that issue was rising.<br/>
Even after resolving it, it just won’t work. Neither with Euler nor with RK4. It just won’t evolve properly. The norm goes crazy. Now I have no clue why it isn’t working.

[research/ms] Still can’t figure what’s really wrong. Checked the <span class="formula">∇<sup>2</sup><i>ψ</i></span> evaluated using the discrete difference formula and compared it to differentiating the interpolated polynomial. The latter looked better, but the difference isn’t all that marked. I suppose I’d be forced to use FFT after all. I suppose the basic difficulty is that in this <span class="formula"><i>ψ̇</i></span> involves a double derivative of <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> itself, whereas in all previous cases that I considered, <span class="formula"><i>q̇</i></span> will usually be a function of <span class="formula"><i>q</i><sup><i>m</i></sup></span> etc. Anyway, changing the approach at this stage doesn’t feel feasable.

While talking to her, realized that we have to keep the <span class="formula">Δ<i>t</i> ⁄ Δ<i>x</i><sup>2</sup> ≤ 10<sup> − 6</sup></span> or so for euler and <span class="formula">10<sup> − 4</sup></span> or so for RK4. I had made another small mistake. I was returning only the real part of <span class="formula">∇<sup>2</sup><i>ψ</i></span> initially (in the differentiation of the interpolate polynomial method). 
</li>
<li>
Talked to Abhishek sir and realized that I wasn’t really using RK4. I had made a mistake in understanding how to implement. After the discussion figured that, fixed it and it started working! The mistake was that I was using different <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>s for finding <span class="formula"><i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>, …</span> whereas to evaluate <span class="formula"><i>k</i><sub>2</sub></span> for example, I needed <span class="formula"><i>x</i> + 0.5 <i>dt</i> <i>k</i><sub>1</sub></span> but <span class="formula"><i>k</i><sub>1</sub></span>is complex in general. So I already had hints on things going wrong. But I realised after that <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i> + 0.5 <i>dt</i> <i>k</i><sub>1</sub></span> is what I had to use because in some sense, I’m treating <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> as a functional. So, given an <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, I have to find <span class="formula"><i>ψ̇</i></span> at different <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span>s not different <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>s. So that fixed things. It was sad though because the interpolation code was completely useless!

<ul>
<li>
[research/ms] Numerics: <ul>
<li>
Got almost all basic stages to work. Was able to get the harmonic oscillator (as was done yesterday). Improved on the parameters. Then attempted to get one particle trajectory. And it worked! 
</li>
<li>
As it turns out, interpolation was not useless but rather important. This is because I needed to find <span class="formula"><i>q̇</i></span> at different <span class="formula"><i>q</i></span>s and <span class="formula"><i>q̇</i></span> is a function of <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i>(<i>q</i>)</span>. So in effect I needed both <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> and <span class="formula">∇<i>ψ</i></span> at arbitrary points. This worked well because I had already the interpolation code. 
</li>
<li>
Next was to generalize this to handle an ensamble of particles. This was done by extending the interpolation code to handle arrays naturally and then the beauty of fortran kicked in and everything eventually started working smooth. Ofcourse I had made minor mistakes here and there, for example trying to add precision(real) to <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> so that I don’t get a division by zero in <span class="formula"><i>q̇</i></span> but that doesn’t work like expected. 
</li>
<li>
Anyway, after all of this, I realized that I need one last thing. I must start with particles distributed according to <span class="formula">|<i>ψ</i>|<sup>2</sup></span>and then evolve them. This did work finally. For this I wrote an algorithm, which was similar to the one I figured as an answer to Bagla sir’s question in the computational physics course. That was a standard method of using the cumulative distribution and then inverting it. This new method was basically something that can be, unlike the former, generalized to arbitrary dimensions (at least intuitively, haven’t proven this). <ul>
<li>
The algorithm is simply this. Start with finding the maximum of the probability density function, call it <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub><span class="text">max</span></sub></span>. Then construct an interval from 0 to <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub><span class="text">max</span></sub></span> and successively choose a point in this interval, and move in constant steps; at some iteration, call this point <span class="formula"><i>h</i></span>. Next, construct random numbers uniformly in the relevant range (over which the PDF is defined; viz. the relevant domain if you’re fussy). Let’s call it for instance <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>. Then check if <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>) &gt; <i>h</i></span>. If it is, then you accept this point (save it in some array that’ll represent the set of points which follow the said distribution). Else you reject the point. Repeat this a fixed number of times for each <span class="formula"><i>h</i></span>. The claim is the set of points you get will satisfy the same PDF. Why it works is intuitively obvious. Start with considering <span class="formula"><i>h</i> = 0</span>. All points are accepted. Then as <span class="formula"><i>h</i></span> increases, fewer and fewer points are accepted; viz. those which are more likely according to the PDF, get more representation in the final set of points. This is readily generalizable. 
</li>
<li>
There is however a major draw back. How many particles you’ll have in the final array is stochastic in this algorithm. However, this can be easily fixed. Consider the further generalization. Find <span class="formula"><i>h</i></span> uniform randomly and then find <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> uniformly randomly as stated. If <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> is accepted, good else repeat till you have enough particles. Because of the stochastic nature of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, increasing <span class="formula"><i>h</i></span> sequentially, or selecting it randomly, both are equivalent. The latter however allows for an obvious way of fixing the number of particles.

[misc] Various maintenance tasks: inbox gmail issue, hdd ordering, git repository issue, updated the log for various days. tel Figured the plan of action. So I must choose between LQG and String Theory. Provisionally I have chosen LQG. I have already started applying to places in Europe keeping this in mind. Now for US also, I can do the same. The only issue is that LQG may not be the best idea. To that end, the strings conference may be the optimal place to figure things. I think thus that I should apply to 3 places that do loop (for US) and then if after talking to some of these people I get more input, perhaps I can apply to 1 or 2 more places. First thing is that I should try to get a TOEFL waiver for these places. I must parallely apply to two places a day in Europe. One in Germany and one in France.<br/>
The next thing is to revise physics/prepare for TIFR etc. That I think I’ll start from tomorrow. Should perhaps spend atleast one hour on typesetting the documentation.

[research/ms] Initiated thinking | Realized that I need an optimized operator of the form <span class="formula"><i>Y</i>’ = <i>U</i><sup>†</sup><i>YU</i></span> so that my commutations are preserved. This doesn’t seem all that trivial. The other approach is to construct everything for the variable <span class="formula"><i>φ</i></span> instead of the position <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, where the periodicity is natural and can be harnessed to construct eigenstates quite naturally. To progress along this direction one needs to construct the momentum operator in the polar coordinates. Now we know that <span class="formula">∇ = <i>r̂</i>∂ ⁄ ∂<i>r</i> + <i>θ̂</i>(1 ⁄ <i>r</i>)∂ ⁄ ∂<i>θ</i> + <i>φ̂</i>(1 ⁄ <i>r</i>sin<i>θ</i>)∂ ⁄ ∂<i>φ</i></span> and thus one can imagine how to construct the ‘radial component of the momentum operator’<span class="formula"> ≡ <i>p̂</i><sub><i>r</i></sub></span>. However as it turns out, the more useful quantity (routinely encountered) is the radial part of <span class="formula">∇<sup>2</sup></span>, where by part I mean the one that can be separated/depends only on <span class="formula"><i>r</i></span>. Why that’s an issue is because first of all, one must know what it means to talk about <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i><sub><i>r</i></sub></span> as one can show that <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i><sub><i>r</i></sub> = <span class="text">symmetrized{</span><i>r</i><sup> − 1</sup>( − <i>i</i>ℏ∇).<i>r</i><span class="text">}</span></span> and that itself becomes slightly messy. Then one must know how this will be measured. I already am not very clear about the momentum is measured off of the screen in our earlier work, let alone in polar coordinates. This however doesn’t mean it is a dead end. I’ll try to explore the first direction first.<ul>
<li>
One quick calculation one can attempt is to try to swap the position of the following operators (attempt a commutation like behaviour): <div class="formula">

</span>
</div>
where <span class="formula"><i>L</i><sub>2</sub></span> is the distance over which the position is modulo over.

<li>
Next one can try to ask a more relevant question, which is: Does <span class="formula">∃ <span class="text">a </span><i>U</i></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>Lf</i>(<i>x̂</i><sub><span class="text">mod</span></sub>) ⁄ <i>h</i></sup> = <i>Û</i><sup>†</sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>L</i> ⁄ <i>h</i></sup><i>Û</i></span> ?

[research/ms] Was able to make good progress today. So here’s what I did. First of all, consider the same states <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span>, <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> for <span class="formula"><i>N</i> = 8</span>, as those considered in my first paper. Recall that for <span class="formula"><i>Ẑ</i></span> as defined there, viz. <span class="formula"><i>Ẑ</i> = <i>Z</i>(<i>q̂</i><sub><span class="unknown">\mod</span>2<i>L</i></sub>)</span>, or more precisely as <span class="formula"><i>Ẑ</i> = <i>Z</i>(<i>q̂</i>) = <span class="text">sgn</span>(sin(<i>q̂</i><i>π</i> ⁄ <i>L</i>))</span>, we had <span class="formula"><i>Ẑ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ẑ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> =  − <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. In addition to this, I define <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i> = <i>e</i><sup> − <i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>L</i> ⁄ ℏ</sup></span> (as opposed to defining it to be hermitian). Now, we know that<span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>±</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≡ <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span> is not an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i></span>. <span class="blue">We infact used expectation values there and were able to show that for high enough <span class="formula"><i>N</i></span>, everything works out alright. Keeping the operator simple, helps retaining the commutation relations to a reasonable degree and consequently makes it easier to arrive at a violation. Now however, if we construct a more optimized operator, we might just be able to get away with requiring precise commutation relations to hold. </span>So we optimize the observable <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i></span> to <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’ ≡ <i>X̂</i><i>T̂</i></span>, where <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i> ≡ <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>NLa</i>(<i>q̂</i>) ⁄ 2</sup></span> where <div class="formula">

The idea is that you shift certain peaks to the right place, before applying the displacement operator <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i></span>. To illustrate this, consider explicitly <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">(</span><span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 4</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 3</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">)</span> ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">4</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>. The operation of <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i></span> is <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub>4</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 5</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub>3</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub> − 6</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub><i>n</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>φ</i><sub><i>n</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> for <span class="formula"><i>n</i> ∈ { − 4,  − 3,  − 2,  − 1, 1, 2}</span>. It is now evident that <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’ = <i>X̂</i><i>T̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Note also that <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’<sup>†</sup><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Similarly <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’<span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’<sup>†</sup></span> does the same. So finally, now consider <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≡ <span class="symbol">(</span><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">)</span> ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>. With <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> ≡ <i>X̂</i>’⊗<i>Ŷ</i>’⊗<i>Ŷ</i>’<sup>†</sup></span>, where <span class="formula"><i>Ŷ</i>’ ≡ <i>i</i><i>Ẑ</i><i>X̂</i>’</span>, calculations yield <span class="formula"><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. With <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i> ≡ <i>Ŷ</i>’<sup>†</sup>⊗<i>X̂</i>’⊗<i>Ŷ</i>’</span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ĉ</i> ≡ <i>Ŷ</i>’⊗<i>Ŷ</i>’<sup>†</sup>⊗<i>X̂</i>’</span> also, by symmetry we get <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ĉ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Now <span class="formula"><i>D̂</i> ≡ <i>Â</i><i>B̂</i><i>Ĉ</i> = <i>X̂</i>’⊗<i>Ŷ</i>’<i>X̂</i><i>Ŷ</i>’<sup>†</sup>⊗<i>X̂</i>’</span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ê</i> ≡ <i>X̂</i>’⊗<i>X̂</i>’⊗<i>X̂</i>’</span> yield the paradox. If values were predefined, the value of <span class="formula"><i>D̂</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ê</i></span> would return the same answer. However, a simple calculation yields <span class="formula"><i>D̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> (this can be seen directly by applying <span class="formula"><i>Â</i>,  <i>B̂</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Ĉ</i></span> sequentially on <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> [was figured the next day]), while <span class="formula"><i>Ê</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> =  − <span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. <ul>

Experimental Setup: Not even clear what measuring <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’</span> really means.
</li>
<li>
As it turns out, even if you construct Hermitian <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’  +  <span class="text">h.c.</span></span>, even then its square works out alright, so long as the subspace is restricted to linear combinations of <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>0</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub>1</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Thus thinking of <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’</span> might still have some meaning. However it’s not as obvious as the <span class="formula">cos(<i>pL</i> ⁄ ℏ)</span> and <span class="formula">exp(<i>ipL</i> ⁄ ℏ)</span> relation.

[research/ms] Figured that even <span class="formula"><i>Ĥ</i></span> is not all that trivial to measure. For instance, for a free particle, measuring <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i></span> is enough. Now consider a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential and is in an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>Ĥ</i></span>. Now ofcourse, the energy of the particle can’t be measured by measuring the position and momentum (<span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span>) unlike in classical mechanics where the very state of the system is defined by <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span> and once that’s known, every function of it is well defined. This is the very first, almost trivial <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>q̂</i>, <i>p̂</i>)</span> which can be investigated to understand how one can measure such quantities in general. Talked to Bagla sir and he couldn’t help. During the Cosmology and Gravitation class, I figured doing the following may help. (1) Take the large <span class="formula"><i>N</i></span> limit and see how with <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’</span> and <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i></span> both, one gets the same result on the state <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>G</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. (2) Consider using expectation values for your result and measure that directly. Write a simulation with just this (for in this case, both constructing the test and making measurements is easy). (3) Define some equivalent sets <span class="formula"><i>Â</i>, <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>Â</i>’, <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i>’<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> s.t. the result of measuring <span class="formula"><i>Â</i>, <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> is equivalent to measuring <span class="formula"><i>Â</i>’, <span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i>’<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Then I came back and got stuck at evaluating <span class="formula"><i>dI</i></span> from <span class="formula"><i>I</i></span>. Also talked to Abhishek sir and he didn’t know.

[research/ms] Talked to Prof. Arvind, made quick progress. He told me that formally, any &ldquo;Hermitian&rdquo; operator, <span class="formula"><i>Q̂</i></span>, can be measured by introducing an apparatus and a measurement apparatus with the following interaction Hamiltonian (for a short time) <span class="formula"><i>Ĥ</i> =  − <i>a</i><i>Q̂</i><i>p̂</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span>. However, I realized that the way I was thinking earlier, was infact a little different. I was asking if there exists some interaction so that a measurement of the particle’s position yields the value of the observable <span class="formula"><i>Q̂</i></span> at the earlier time? That I doubt is helpful but anyway. Further, I started and finished reading the measurement section of Bohm’s second paper. Figured it was precisely the same as what sir was saying.

[research/ms] Spent quite some time on figuring how to extend the analysis done for <span class="formula"><i>Q̂</i></span> with a discrete spectrum to that with a continuous spectrum, with <span class="formula"><i>Q̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub><i>q</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>q</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><sub><i>q</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Finally figured I was making a mistake, the state corresponding to <span class="formula"><i>φ</i>(<i>y</i> + <i>L</i>)</span> is <span class="formula"><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∫</span></span><i>dy</i> <i>φ</i>(<i>y</i> + <i>L</i>)<span class="symbol">|</span><i>y</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, and not <span class="formula"><span class="limits"><span class="limit">∫</span></span><i>dy</i> <i>ψ</i>(<i>y</i> + <i>L</i>)<span class="symbol">|</span><i>y</i> + <i>L</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> (yes it sounds foolish now). I was able to show that if the &ldquo;apparatus&rdquo; is initially at position <span class="formula">0</span>, with spread <span class="formula"><i>δ</i><i>y</i></span>, then after measurement, say one obtained <span class="formula"><i>y</i>’</span>. The eigenvalue this will correspond to is <span class="formula"><i>q</i> = (1 ⁄ <i>ta</i>)(<i>y</i>’±2<i>δ</i><i>y</i>)</span>.<br/>
So this essentially means that <span class="formula"><i>Q̂</i></span> is only required to be Hermitian. Then, once we know the complete set of eigenfunctions, we are through. I therefore tried evaluating the eigenfunctions of <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’</span>. To get some insight, I started with <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i></span> and there itself it got hard. One can write it as <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> or as functions periodic in the position space, with periodicity <span class="formula"><i>L</i></span>. The difficulty is making them equivalent. Showing the latter to be complete anyway won’t work for I have constructed only two functions (with eigenvalues <span class="formula">±1</span>). By the time <span class="formula"><i>X̂</i>’</span> is used, even <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> ceases to be an eigenstate and I end up with only the position space constrained functions. So that’s a big mess.<br/>
Also realized that the measurement scheme is also essentially just a displacement operator.

[research/ms] Talked to Arvind sir again (yesterday’s meeting had gotten cancelled). Kichoo finally talked about randomness certification etc. and it looks rather interesting. I think he’ll be able to do something new with it. I wanted to see if contextuality could be used instead. Anyway, coming back to my work, I explained all that I had done yesterday to sir. He said that we don’t need the full spectrum. If my state can be expressed a linear combination of the eigenstates I’ve already found, then I’m good to go. I can skip the ‘hard’ part. He also seemed to have liked the optimization operator <span class="formula"><i>T̂</i></span>. Infact, I just realized I told him that I’ll explain to him the details of the test (perhaps in the next meeting). <br/>
Further, I just realized that one can infact <i>measure non-hermitian operators</i> also. The only requirement will be that (a) the eigenvalue for the some states is real and (b) the state being measured is at most a superposition of these states. This is exciting and I must talk to sir and get this verified. Ofcourse the question is then, what happens when you use the same measurement scheme (that of measuring non-hermitian operators) to measure a state that doesn’t satisfy (b)? Looks like that it will fail to satisfy Schrödinger’s equation (the time evolution will become non-unitary), viz. probability densities won’t be conserved. So for now, I must translate this into a simulator problem. I was wondering however, if I should use the two degrees of freedom of the same particle or should I use two 1-d particles? We’ll see. Infact, my preliminary feeling is that simulations aren’t exactly needed. I may have to plot some functions, if at all.

[research/ms] Worked out some more eigenstates (infact arbitrary eigenvalued) of the displacement operator. Figured how to construct the relevant state by a straight forward generalization of the GHZ state and my previous work on the Bell Test. I am now confused about whether I should try doing the Bell test first, or if I should try doing the GHZ test. A little exploration reveals that the most interesting (that I can think of) method would be to use the Wigner functions for the operators. In that spirit, the Bell test is almost trivial (applying the unitaries is almost trivial). Thereafter, the wigner functions may be evaluated directly. Infact, this tells me that if there’re really trajectories (as described by Bohmian mechanics), then what would be the difference between quantities evaluated as averaged for various bohmian trajectories vs. evaluated using the Wigner function formalism? Why must negative probabilities come into play?<br/>
However, the point for me at the moment is that I must start writing the simulation. For that I need the broadest (in the sense of what the targets that can be achieved) and the simplest requirements.

[research/ms] Thought about it at various times. What was troubling me was the following: If the GHZ test infact says that (q,p) can’t be non-contextually deterministic, then how can BM, where (q,p) are infact non-contextually deterministic, be consistent with it? There are a few things that need to be understood. <br/>
First, note that if a Bohmian particle has position <span class="formula"><i>q</i><sub>0</sub></span> and momentum <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>0</sub></span>, then the measurement of an ‘observable’ which is a function of <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i></span>, will infact correspond to the same function, with <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i></span> replaced by <span class="formula"><i>q</i><sub>0</sub></span>. Similarly for a function of <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i></span> only. But here comes the subtlety, if one measures an observable which is an arbitrary combination of <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i></span> , eg. <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i> + <i>p̂</i></span> or even <span class="formula"><i>Ĥ</i> = <i>p̂</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>V</i>(<i>q̂</i>)</span>, then upon measurement, the value will <i>not</i> be the same function with <span class="formula"><i>q</i><sub>0</sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>0</sub></span> in place of the operators. I must find out if values of all observables are determined completely by <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> and the initial positions of the particle. One quick example that can be thought of is that of a Harmonic oscillator; the particle can have essentially arbitrary <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span> but will correspond to the same energy, if <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> is an energy eigenket to start with. <br/>
Second, in the GHZ test, the usual structure is that one measures <span class="formula"><i>A</i> = <i>X</i>⊗<i>Y</i>⊗<i>Y</i></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>C</i></span> (implicitly defined). The contradiction we get essentially hinges on the claim that if <span class="formula"><i>X</i>, <i>Y</i></span> have well defined values, then <span class="formula"><i>ABC</i></span> should essentially yield a situation identical to measurement of <span class="formula"><i>X</i>⊗<i>X</i>⊗<i>X</i></span>. However that needn’t be. Take for example the non-contextually deterministic theory, BM. Within BM, measuring <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>C</i></span> will yield values corresponding to the <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span> values of the three particles (by corresponding we mean that <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i>↔<i>q</i>, <i>p̂</i>↔<i>p</i></span>). However, a measurement of <span class="formula"><i>ABC</i></span>, will not yield a value that directly corresponds to <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span>, viz. it is not a product of values obtained when <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>C</i></span> are separately measured. <br/>
Thus in essence, we have shown that it is incorrect to conclude from the GHZ argument that determinism (or precisely, a non-contextually deterministic description of nature) can’t exist. <br/>
There are ofcourse various aspects which still need exploration. (a) One possible approach could be to extend the analysis to full blown tests of contextuality, by first appropriately extending them to phase space, and then identifying how BM explains them. This could either be done in the context of quantum optics (for which BM isn’t all that popularly known) or for say, the Mermin type argument (the Mermin square, for two spin half particles). (b) The other direction is to construct an appropriate hidden variable model, that is non-contextually deterministic, but still consistent with the usual GHZ test. The latter should give insight into whether or not the dynamics are essential for the analysis, viz. recall how a direct extension of the BM principle to discretized space gets into trouble (the <span class="formula">∇</span> operator has no analogue); but from the looks of it, a complete analysis of the GHZ phase space test would shed some light on it.<br/>

[research/ms] I have to now, convert the entire GHZ test into a scheme, where only pure functions of the <span class="formula"><i>p</i></span> (or <span class="formula"><i>q</i></span>) are measured. No mixed functions. This means that the scheme I worked out the other day, is essentially useless for the current purposes. Once that’s done, then I must work out what measuring <span class="formula"><i>Y</i><sup>†</sup><i>XY</i></span> essentially yields, viz. given <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> and <span class="formula">(<i>q</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>)</span> what the measurement outcome should be, deterministically.<br/>
One could also try to see how the Wigner function and BM’s <span class="formula">(<i>q</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>0</sub>)</span> + <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> get related eventually.

[research/ms] Finally discussed things with Arvind sir. Explained to him what I had worked out. The outcome was that (a) I try to extend the Mermin’s proof to phase space, (b) Try to simulate the measurement process itself for the GHZ test and (c) glance through the paper sir has provided.<br/>
It isn’t still very clear, how we’re so confident that ‘complicated relation’ between <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>0</sub></span> of the particle and measurement of arbitrary functions of <span class="formula"><i>q̂</i>, <i>p̂</i></span> are so easily consistent with QM. Ofcourse, from the calculation, one will get the eigenvalue corresponding to the operator upon measurement, but given <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>0</sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>q</i><sub>0</sub></span>, precisely which value one obtains, is not a simple exercise to determine. This is where I must use my computational tools. Alternatively, sir suggested I look at this paper where a formulation of QM is presented, wherein <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span> do infact yield the appropriate answers, viz. position and momenta are treated symmetrically.<br/>
Also, it would be interesting to see how the classical limit can be obtained, viz. why classically, a measurement of <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i></span> yields <span class="formula"><i>p</i></span>. Infact in this sense, perhaps one can see precisely what contextuality would mean for classical mechanics. <br/>
I was also able to extend the GHZ setup, to that of contextuality (peres mermin) rather trivially infact. Now the argument becomes even more clear. If one imagines that these variables have pre-defined values, then ‘ofcourse’ <span class="formula"><i>C</i><sub>3</sub> = 1</span> and not <span class="formula"> − 1</span>. The flaw again is that determinism or pre-defined values, don’t entail that you simply multiply the result of observables. You must multiply the observables and then ask what is the observed value. This readily extends to even the <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><i>KS</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, which BM will happily violate. So the claim that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><i>KS</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≤ 4</span> for any non-contextual deterministic theory, is wrong; BM is an exception. The reason has been delineated earlier.<br/>
For my satisfaction though, I’d like to also see how BM is compatible with the no-coloring type of proofs of the KS theorem.<br/>
In addition, I am unclear about how spins can be handled, as in whether spins can be thought of as having predefined value, in the sense just described. But wait, don’t they? Since like <span class="formula">(<i>q</i>, <i>p</i>)</span> by itself doesn’t yield upon measurement <span class="formula"><i>p</i></span> (<span class="formula"><i>q</i></span> maybe it does), similarly, spins also have predefined values, dependent on the <span class="formula">(<i>q</i>, <i>p</i>)</span> and thus compatible with determinism. I just found a paper titled ‘‘Spin and non-locality in quantum mechanics’’, where the spin vector has a pre-defined value. Damn it. Now I feel that the description of nature is not unique after all.<br/>
Finding the classical limit, seems like the best way to proceed. What would that mean for the KS inequality? What about Bell’s inequality? Also, did non-locality have anything specific to contribute to this argument? Was non-locality necessary? These questions still need to be worked out.

[research/ms] It looks like BM is cheating a little. In the sense that it claims that it has a clear classical limit, in which the Hamilton Jacobi framework is recovered. In this limit, it is said that one needn’t worry about measuring the observables as being anything special. The observables will yield the right values. However, for quantum mechanical measurements, the interpretation (or strictly, it’s author) suggests we use the effective Hamiltonian <span class="formula"><i>H</i><sub><i>I</i></sub> = <i>a</i><i>p̂</i><sub>1</sub><i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></span> with <span class="formula">1, 2</span> labelling the system and the auxiliary particle that will measure the momentum, respectively. If one tries to find the classical limit of this measurement process, with the hope that the measurement of <span class="formula"><i>p̂</i><sub>1</sub></span> will infact yield <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = ∇<sub>1</sub><i>S</i></span>, one finds a lot of things getting messed up. First of all, this interaction adds a term to the continuity equation: <div class="formula">
<span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">∂<i>P</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator">∂<i>t</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span> + ∇<sub>1</sub><span class="array"><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-left">⎛</span></span><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-left">⎝</span></span></span><i>P</i><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">∇<sub>1</sub><i>S</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><i>m</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span><span class="array"><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-right">⎞</span></span><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-right">⎠</span></span></span> + ∇<sub>2</sub><span class="array"><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-left">⎛</span></span><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-left">⎝</span></span></span><i>P</i><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">∇<sub>2</sub><i>S</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><i>m</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span><span class="array"><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-right">⎞</span></span><span class="arrayrow"><span class="bracket align-right">⎠</span></span></span> + <span class="overbrace">2<i>aR</i><span class="symbol">[</span>∇<sub>1</sub><i>R</i>∇<sub>2</sub><i>S</i> + <i>R</i>∇<sub>1</sub>∇<sub>2</sub><i>S</i> + ∇<sub>2</sub><i>R</i>∇<sub>1</sub><i>S</i><span class="symbol">]</span></span><sup><span class="text">Extra Term! | How will</span> <i>P</i> <span class="text">satisfy the continuity equation?</span></sup> = 0

The interaction also adds a ‘‘quantum potential’’ in addition to the expected potential, which doesn’t seem to disappear in the large mass limit. <div class="formula">
<span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">∂<i>S</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator">∂<i>t</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">(∇<sub>1</sub><i>S</i>)<sup>2</sup></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2<i>m</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span> + <span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">(∇<sub>2</sub><i>S</i>)<sup>2</sup></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2<i>m</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span> + <span class="overbrace"><i>a</i>∇<sub>1</sub><i>S</i>∇<sub>2</sub><i>S</i></span><sup><span class="text">expected part</span></sup> − <span class="overbrace"><i>a</i>ℏ<sup>2</sup><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">∇<sub>1</sub>∇<sub>2</sub><i>R</i></span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator"><i>R</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span><sup><span class="text"><span class="text">quantum part</span></span></sup> − <span class="underbrace"><span class="fraction"><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="numerator">ℏ</span><span class="ignored">)/(</span><span class="denominator">2<i>mR</i></span><span class="ignored">)</span></span>(∇<span class="scripts"><sup class="script">2</sup><sub class="script">1</sub></span><i>R</i> + ∇<span class="scripts"><sup class="script">2</sup><sub class="script">2</sub></span><i>R</i>)</span><sub><span class="text">usual quantum potential</span></sub> = 0
</div>
Thus, BM can’t do both, have a clear classical limit and be unable to explain the measurement process’s classical limit. Ofcourse all of this is happening primarily because in the usual derivation, the author regarded <span class="formula"><i>V</i> = <i>V</i>(<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>)</span> and not that of <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub></span>. However, this is very unsatisfactory of a theory that in the classical limit, things cease to make sense. One can yet, see that with <span class="formula">ℏ → 0</span>, the quantum potential and the quantum part of the interaction, both disappear. However, the continuity equation is not recovered still. I may have made some calculation mistakes, which I can check later, but at the moment, I must be able to make sense of the notion of measurement in the classical setting, even if this particular method needs to be abandoned; there must however be cogent reasons for doing so.<br/>
Further, it is interesting to note that there’re velocity dependent forces (non-dicipative) such as Corioli’s force that should perhaps result in a momentum dependent potential. In this case, it would be interesting to see how BM trajectories behave.<br/>
Infact, what about galelian invariance? How does that come in the picture in BM? Looks like that’ll be fine; one only needs to change <span class="formula"><i>x</i> → <i>x</i> − <i>vt</i></span> where <span class="formula"><i>v</i></span> is just a constant. Let’s anyway see.

[research/ms] Today I had an interesting thought. While I was convinced that there must be something wrong with the following argument, the argument seemed to be sound. The argument would lead to the conclusion that one can communicate faster than light, if Bohmian Mechanics is right. So the idea of BM is that since we don’t know the initial position of the particles precisely, we can’t quite make predictions stronger than CM. However, consider this. <br/>
There are two particles, one with person A, and the other with person B. Now both measure the position of their particles. Thus the positions are precisely known. Next, they allow their particles to evolve under a Hamiltonian (interaction) such that they become entangled. Suppose at time <span class="formula"><i>t</i></span>, the particles are entangled. Now from the de-Broglie theory, both can predict the locations of their particles at <span class="formula"><i>t</i></span>. Now comes the interesting part. The protocol they follow, is as follows. Say A uses this setup, only to receive signals. If B wants to send a signal to A, all that he needs to do, is to disturb his particle at <span class="formula"><i>t</i></span>. This would cause some change in, either the wavefunction or the position, or both, of the particle, compared to if B had not caused any disturbance. Now B measures her particle’s position at <span class="formula"><i>t</i> + <i>ϵ</i></span> and gets the value <span class="formula"><i>x</i><sub><i>B</i></sub></span>. She knows what position her particle should’ve been at, if B didn’t do anything, call this position <span class="formula"><i>x</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">(0)</sup><sub class="script"><i>B</i></sub></span></span>. If now <span class="formula"><i>x</i><sub><i>B</i></sub> ≠ <i>x</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">(0)</sup><sub class="script"><i>B</i></sub></span></span>, then she knows B sent a signal. If <span class="formula"><i>x</i><sub><i>B</i></sub> = <i>x</i><span class="scripts"><sup class="script">(0)</sup><sub class="script"><i>B</i></sub></span></span>, then she knows nothing was sent. Since the equations are non-local, this interaction is instantaneous, and in principle faster than speed of light.<br/>
Ofcourse, one can fill in the details, which is what I almost started doing, but finding the fault in the argument is what was pivotal. It turns out, the fault was rather straight forward, although a little subtle. The idea is that regardless of how precise the position measurement is, its uncertainty will spread with the wavefunction, thereby rendering any prediction useless. Thus, in this light, chaos restores locality. This is actually not too hard to see. Imagine you have an uncertainty <span class="formula"><i>δ</i><i>x</i></span>, when you measured the position and got the value <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>. Now we can imagine a gaussian associated with this, as the wavefunction, after collapse. Since the de-Broglie Bohm theory ensures that the probability distribution <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><sup>2</sup></span> is preserved by the dynamics of the particles, as <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span> evolves, <span class="formula"><i>δ</i><i>x</i></span> will increase (in case of free evolution), effectively destroying ’position information’. The idea can only be harnessed, if one can somehow decouple the uncertainty in <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> from the wavefunction. One possibility I considered was that of very strong ineractions, where the wavefunction changes dramatically, but <span class="formula">∇<i>S</i></span> doesn’t, so that <span class="formula"><i>q̇</i></span> is small, and thus <span class="formula"><i>δ</i><i>q</i></span> doesn’t change much. This idea, I don’t suppose will work but can be tried.<br/>
Another thing one might want to work out, is how a delta function in position evolves, according to bohmian mechanics.

[research/ms] Today was rather interesting. I read through the paper by Roy and Singh, which talked about a symmetric treatment of position and momentum in a causal theory of QM. I even started reading the sequal where they show how this maybe extended to <span class="formula"><i>n</i></span> particles. I haven’t completely read it. I have the following questions though. First of all, since <span class="formula"><i>q</i>, <i>p</i></span> are now precisely what they’ll turn out to be if measured, then that makes a lot of the things I was working on rather simple. I can now go ahead and try to answer my question, viz. what happens to contextuality in the classical limit? I ask this for it looks rather binary to me, unlike the uncertainty principles. Next I can ask, what meaning does parity have, in this new causal mechanics. I feel it would be now great to attempt the GHZ test and the Peres Mermin test. Another thing that surprises me is that how can the probability <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><sup>2</sup></span> be conserved by the particles, if they don’t follow the de-broglie equation, which was just the probability current? I would like to simulate both and see how they differ. Ofcourse, various details of the theory need to be worked out, for the functions required, don’t seem so straight forward for being numerically solved. I also think that using the optimized variables I had defined, to further extend the Bell test would be rather interesting. It is worth noting that the issue with the classical limit of measuring momentum disappears here, as the question doesn’t arise, although I would like to see the same happen with BM.<br/>
On the larger scale, until the QM &amp; BM stage, I was convinced that BM is perhaps a more detailed description, which when averaged, yields the right QM description. However, I am now confused again. With the RS (Roy Singh) description, I am unclear about which description is correct, or to be precise, I am unclear about the notion that nature has a unique description. Which seems to suggest that we have hit a stage where in the accuracy of our description of nature, can only be tested to a certain level (and its not about lack of technology), beyond which, atleast at the moment, it appears it is impossible to tell which is right. Looks like a rather important lesson for Quantum Gravity.<br/>
Another thing I thought of, was that of constructing a test which didn’t have the shortcomings of the Bell &amp; Contextuality test, wherein the possibility of change happening due to measurements, is not considered. This earlier was rather important because of two reasons. (1) In BM itself, the value of <span class="formula"><i>p</i></span> depends on the measurement but more importantly (2) that measuring <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and getting a value <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>, and similarly for <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> getting a value <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> doesn’t entail that measuring <span class="formula"><i>AB</i></span> would yield the value <span class="formula"><i>ab</i></span>. The idea I was raising was that while Bell’s test is robust under allowing ‘measurements’ to modify values, tests of Contextuality are not.<br/>
Ok so something is still wrong. I thought somebody had proven that one can’t have all possible sets of commuting variables, have a probability distribution, due to ‘contextuality’. But if what I understood is right, then according to BM, all outcomes are deterministic. So where’s the catch? BM just sods it off by saying that the initial conditions include the initial position/momentum of the particle and therefore it is not included the type of theories considered by ‘contextuality’ like proofs. I then ask, that in the RS theory, clearly momentum doesn’t require anymore knowledgeof the particle, than does a position measurement (both of them don’t that is). Thus, it is natural to ask, what properties of the system, can be assumed to have a value, independent of measurement (I don’t mean lack of determinism, I mean it doesn’t depend on the initial conditions of the apparatus)? Can we construct a theory, wherein all observables have well defined values, regardless? I know it won’t conflict with, atleast the Peres Mermin type arguments, simply because there we run into the <span class="formula"><i>AB</i></span> type of confusion. Antithetically though, the RS paper seemed to claim that such a description may not be possible.<br/>
One more question that can be addressed is, how to construct an ‘almost’ <span class="formula"><i>SU</i>(<i>N</i>)</span> algebra, out of <span class="formula"><i>p</i>, <i>q</i></span>. We have already shown how to construct the <span class="formula"><i>SU</i>(2)</span> structure (which was also already known). This is interesting, for then one can use contextuality in a single particle. This would then strongly challenge the view (proof?) that non-locality is a special case of contextuality. If I can simply construct a contextuality test in phase space, using a single particle, then I think I’d be done. But interestingly, I now recall, Ali had done something similar. He used, instead of displacement operators in one direction and the other direction specifically, a combination of displacements in the two directions and used the geometric phase to his advantage. So even though his operators were those used for quantum optics (for quadrature) and not quite position and momentum, the analogues to exist. Which means that at once, it can be shown that contextuality and non-locality are different.<br/>
Now, non-locality as we showed earlier, can be shown to disappear (atleast partly), using chaos. However, how does one show Bell like non-locality? Or if one can show why we must have a <span class="formula">2<span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span> as maximum violation.

[research/ms] I realized today that the contextuality test is constructed in a slightly more interesting way. They don’t just say that <span class="formula"><i>AB</i> → <i>ab</i></span> if <span class="formula"><i>A</i> → <i>a</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i> → <i>b</i></span>. They say that if <span class="formula">[<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>] = 0</span>, then <span class="formula"><i>f</i>(<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>) → <i>f</i>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>)</span> if <span class="formula"><i>A</i> → <i>a</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i> → <i>b</i></span>. So I basically wanted to go against this. Obviously, if one starts with a system in the state <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>a</i>, <i>b</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, then it will follow. However, it is possible to find an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>AB</i></span>, which is neither an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> nor an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span>. This calculation was done (fine, using online mathematica like stuff) on <span class="formula"><i>A</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>AB</i> =  − <i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span>. Obviously, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> is not an eigenstate of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> (nor of <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span>). Thus measuring <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> will always correspond to the same value, <span class="formula">1</span>, however my theory can assign <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> to <span class="formula">±</span>. Thereby violating the condition that <span class="formula"><i>AB</i> → <i>ab</i></span>. Ofcourse these guys don’t even consider issues related to disturbing the system after measurement, but that maybe partly justified as all <span class="formula"><i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>AB</i></span> commute. This was an interesting realization and result, as far as my understanding is concerned. TODO: write the details.

[research/ms] One possibility is to construct a test (to test memory, which is ‘required’ for any contextual theory) where, alright. First imagine that we have commuting observables given by <span class="formula">[<i>A</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub>, <i>A</i><sub><i>ik</i></sub>] = 0</span> and <span class="formula">[<i>A</i><sub><i>ji</i></sub>, <i>A</i><sub><i>ki</i></sub>] = 0</span>. So for a non-invasive system that remembers what I measured before, I measure these in the said order <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>11</sub>,  <i>A</i><sub>12</sub>,  <i>A</i><sub>13</sub></span> and then take another identical copy, measure <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>33</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>23</sub>, <i>A</i><sub>13</sub></span> and compare the value of <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>13</sub></span>. If the value of <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>13</sub></span> is different, then I know that my non-invasive system is contextual. Note that non-invasiveness is important, else we can’t say if the system is contextual or if post measurement, the system obtains a new assignment. It will be more tricky to construct such tests for invasive systems.<br/>
Ofcourse one can generalize this to finding if assignment of <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub><i>ij</i></sub></span> is contextual by measuring it in the two different contexts, and to varying amounts.<br/>
To find values which don’t have any context, we may choose to measure along parallel diagonals.<br/>
To get some handle on non-invasive systems, let’s imagine that if say a measurement is <i>unfaithful</i>, (viz. if a repeated measurement of some observable <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>11</sub></span>, on identically prepared system, yields different values, with certain probabilities) then we can imagine certain hidden variables, which are not in our control, are causing the variance. As an approximation, we assume that whenever these measurements yield the same result, the system has the same underlying hidden variables. It may happen that after measuring one <i>unfaithful</i> operator on two systems, we find the hidden variables are approximately the same, then upon subsequent measurement of the next <i>unfaithful</i> operator, one might discover that the value obtained for the two systems is different. In this case, one learns that the system didn’t infact have the same hidden variables. If one does obtain the same value, then again one continues to assume that the underlying hidden variables are the same. <br/>
This construction maybe completely irrelevant though, since we would like to compare systems with identical hidden variables to start with, and then make <i>different</i> measurements.<br/>
To make some progress, I can imagine a black box, which takes in two states, and tells me if they are identical (including the hidden variables). I don’t still learn what those hidden variables are, just that two systems are identical. (TODO: ensure this is correct). Ofcourse, in the final test, I don’t want invokation to any such box, but to start, let’s see if I can proceed assuming such a box exists.<br/>
It turns out, there’re various smaller, more tractable issues that need resolution. (a) Consider a theory that assigns values to the peres mermin observables. Now upon each measurement, <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>33</sub></span> is assigned a new value (<span class="formula">1 →  − 1</span> and <span class="formula"> − 1 → 1</span>). | Now is (a) contextual? Is it multiplicative? [Our target is to construct by hand, a non-contextual hidden variable theory, that can violate the KCBS inequality.] (a) is clearly not multiplicative. If I measure <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>11</sub><i>A</i><sub>33</sub></span> in a single shot, I will get an answer which will be different from measuring <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>11</sub></span> and then measuring <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>33</sub></span> and taking the product <span class="formula"><i>a</i><sub>11</sub><i>a</i><sub>33</sub></span>. Infact, my theory doesn’t explicitly tell me the assignment for <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>11</sub><i>A</i><sub>33</sub></span>. [What happened to measuring compatible observables together? What role does that play? Will contextuality handle that aspect?]<br/>
One approach I can follow is, to take the most obvious, non-contextual multiplicative hidden variable assignment and then make a small change in that (like I just did). Then investigate which property has changed, among non-contextuality and multiplicativity. Note that in doing so, definitions of contextuality and multiplicativity will need to be refined. So start with some definitions, and as you refine, show why the alternatives don’t make enough sense (or how they trivialize things). Proceed iteratively, to an assignment, that is non-contextual and yet violates the KCBS inequality. If you’re able to retain multiplicativity, great. If not, that’s also alright.<br/>
Also, one must add a boolean property, <i>efficacy</i>. This would be true, if the model is s.t. sequential measurement of commuting observables, behave as faithful observables, viz. their values don’t change.<br/>
I infact realized, that one might think that multiplicativity and commutativity are the same thing. But surprisingly, this is not so. It looks like, in our analysis, we’ll end up showing that a violation of the KCBS inequality implies that nature is either contextual, or non-multiplicative or both. From the perspective of BM, nature is non-contextual, but multiplicative. Perhaps in other HV models of QM, nature can be made multplicative but contextual. However, we can’t have a HV model that is non-contextual and multiplicative, which consistently describes nature.<br/>
The outstanding challenge now is, first of all, write all of these things systematically with proper examples constructed (as suggested in the approach above). And second, try to construct a new test, which can distinguish between multiplicativity and contextuality.<br/>
I have a feeling that all of this has something to do with the maximal set of commuting operators. This property is rather strange.

[research/ms] Figured two interesting things today. First, one can start with assuming that theories are non-invasive, which means that they admit measurement schemes which are non-invasive; viz. measurements can be made without disturbing the system. With this, one can construct two sets of theories. Each has only one non-classical feature, one is contextual and the other non-multiplicative. With these, one can construct the non-imaginative, but standard (that’s why non-imaginative) Peres Mermin situation. Describe the two variants of the KCBS test. Variant one will be violated by both, contextual and non-multiplicative theories. However, variant two will be violated only by the contextual theory. <br/>
The other interesting thing I figured, was that while a measurement of <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> + <i>B̂</i></span> doesn’t mean that the result will be <span class="formula"><i>a</i> + <i>b</i></span>, (where <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> is the value obtained upon measurement of <span class="formula"><i>Â</i></span> separately, and <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> is that of <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i></span>), however, according to QM, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i> + <i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Thus, on an average, measurement of <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> + <i>B̂</i></span> will be the same as measuring <span class="formula"><i>Â</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i></span> separately, average separately, and add. Note how the experiments are entirely different. This may prove pivotal in two ways. First, this shows how QM distinguishes between addition and multiplication of observables, quite explicitly. Second, this will help in extending the aforesaid scenario, even when we give up non-invasiveness. Then we will be able to show if QM is truly contextual or not. Ofcourse, one also needs to see this in the light of the assumption that <span class="formula">[<i>Â</i>, <i>B̂</i>] = 0</span>.<br/>
Further, I need to see if the <i>multiplicity</i> argument holds for addition also, viz. for <span class="formula">[<i>Â</i>, <i>B̂</i>] = 0</span>, if <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> → <i>a</i></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i> → <i>b</i></span>, then does require <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> + <i>B̂</i> → <i>a</i> + <i>b</i></span>? This is certainly required on an average, viz. <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i> + <i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, unlike multiplication, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i><i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≠ <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>B̂</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. The commutativity argument doesn’t figure here, since we’re talking about compatible observables.

[research/ms] Finished writing the main ideas in the draft. They look interesting. So the final argument goes as follows. A multiplicative theory will yield <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><span class="text">KCBS</span></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. For simplistic ‘deterministic’ theories, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><span class="text">KCBS</span></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≤ 4</span>. A theory that violates the KCBS but not <span class="formula">χ<sub>2</sub></span>, is certainly non-classical in some way, but must be non-multiplicative. As we have demonstrated (to do), for QM, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><span class="text">KCBS</span></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≠ <span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> in general, thus predictions of QM can’t be explained by any theory that is multiplicative. More specifically, we have ruled out contextual theories, which are multiplicative, as candidates for describing the quantum world. These theories are usually believed to be the appropriate alternative candidates to simplistic ‘deterministic’ theories. <i>In fact, one can remove contextuality completely from the picture;</i> there exist formulations of quantum mechanics in terms of hidden variables, which are non-contextual and non-multiplicative. They are consistent with all predictions of QM, including violation of the KCBS inequality.<br/>
I need to work on the following. <br/>
(1) Not that the progress so far is particularly depressing, but it would be great if I could somehow construct a true test of contextuality. Also, I would imagine that one can construct a better test of multiplicativity. I think I should try to focus on this independent of contextuality. On specific states, it is easy to show. I must aim at constructing a state independent test. But as usual, let me start with state dependent ones and see what progress I can make. <br/>
(2) I should either show this analytically, or numerically, that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub><span class="text">KCBS</span></sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≠ <span class="symbol">⟨</span>χ<sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Infact, if I can show this for even one state, it is enough to show that QM is not multiplicative.

[research/ms] Constructed an incorrect ‘proof’ of contextuality in 2 dimensions! Was convinced it is correct to start with and then found the flaw. Started working on a test of multiplicativity, independent of that of contextuality. Initially I felt I was just trying to come up with some operator identity that numbers won’t satisfy. This again became an orthodox contextuality like test. I realized later that the test for multiplicativity is actually quite different in spirit. So I started with constructing a state dependent test. In general, one can write the simplest test as follows. Consider two observables <span class="formula"><i>A</i>,  <i>B</i></span>, s.t. <span class="formula">[<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>] = 0</span>. For a multiplicative theory, <span class="formula"><i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>) − <i>m</i>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i>(<i>B</i>) = 0</span>. This also entails that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i>(<i>B</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = 0</span>. If I can show that there exists some state for which <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>B</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≠ 0</span>, then I’m through. Ofcourse, it is also possible that on an average, the equality holds, but there exist special events where it is violated. One can consider those, but a more robust and experiment friendly method would be to find some averaged expression.<br/>
Some possible directions for explicit examples include: Choose <span class="formula"><i>a</i>, <i>b</i></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>a</i></sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>q̂</i><i>b</i></sup> = <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>q̂</i><i>b</i></sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>a</i></sup></span>, basically so that for <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> = <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>p̂</i><i>a</i></sup></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i> = <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>q̂</i><i>b</i></sup></span>, <span class="formula">[<i>Â</i>, <i>B̂</i>] = 0</span>. Now, one needs to cook up the right state to see if a violation can be arrived at. Further, one can use the <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> state, with <span class="formula"><i>A</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span>. This would be a 2 qubit example. Finally, for a two qubit case, perhaps using <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>1</sub> = <span class="symbol">|</span>0<span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">⟨</span>0<span class="symbol">|</span></span>, and <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>2</sub> = <span class="symbol">|</span>1<span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">⟨</span>1<span class="symbol">|</span></span> on a superposition <span class="formula">(<span class="symbol">|</span>0<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>1<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span> would make most sense. <br/>
I also thought of how this maybe extended to addition. For instance, measurement of <span class="formula"><i>O</i> = <i>A</i> + <i>B</i></span>, will always be s.t. <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>O</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>A</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>B</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, according to QM. According to a multiplicative theory, <span class="formula"><i>m</i>(<i>O</i>) = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i>) + <i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>B</i>)</span>, where the order is not important. Upon averaging, we will get <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>O</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>A</i>) + <i>m</i>(<i>B</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>A</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>m</i>(<i>B</i>)<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Consequently, I will see no violation, on an average. A suggested modification is to define <span class="formula"><i>C</i>: = <i>AB</i></span>, so that <span class="formula"><i>O</i> = <i>CB</i><sup> − 1</sup> + <i>A</i><sup> − 1</sup><i>C</i></span>. Now perhaps a sequential can be done on the latter two and a violation arrived at. This however, seems to not be as neat as I’d like (even if it works that is).<br/>

[research/ms] New word for multiplicative. Absolutely compatible; observables maybe compatible, but can’t be absolutely compatible; weakly compatible := ! absolutely compatible. Inert measure, Multimeasure (veto), progressively measurable, completely compatible, incompletely compatible, partially compatible. A theory in which all compatible observables are completely compatible, is itself called completely compatible. A theory in which even one compatible observable is not completely compatible, is called partially compatible. Any theory that is not completely compatible, is equivalent to being partially compatible.<br/>
Also thought about and realised why I wanted a different test of multiplicativity and why the <span class="formula">χ<sub>2</sub></span> test was useful. The <span class="formula">χ<sub>2</sub></span> test was useful, because it worked very well with the theories I was discussing (the two extremes). Now I want a test that is violated by QM.

What can be said about non-locality, it’s relation to contextuality; what about Bell’s test? Does that have anything to do with multiplicativity? What about all the beautiful properties such as monogamy associated with the Bell test and Contextuality? Where do these things stand in this new perspective? I have a feeling that something rather interesting is in store for us.<br/>
After trying to construct an explicit test for multiplicativity, I realized that QM doesn’t infact violate it. In essence, consider <span class="formula"><i>A</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span>, <span class="formula"><i>B</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span>. Now one can verify that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[ +  + ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = ( − <i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[ +  − ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = ( − <i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span>01<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>10<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[ −  + ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = (<i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span>01<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>10<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span> and <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[ −  − ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = (<i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span> are eigenkets of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> with eigenvalues <span class="formula">±, ±</span> as used in the nomenclature. Now for the state, <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, we know that a measurement of <span class="formula"><i>AB</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span> would yield the value <span class="formula"> + 1</span>. Infact, <span class="formula"><i>AB</i><span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. However, since <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> is neither an eigenket of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>, nor an eigenket of <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span>, a measurement of either will collapse the state to some other state. A measurement of <span class="formula"><i>AB</i></span> would leave the state invariant. This seemed to suggest that perhaps, this setup can be used to establish non-multiplicativity of QM. That isn’t however the case. This is so because <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = (<span class="symbol">|</span>[ +  + ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>[ −  − ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span>) ⁄ <span class="sqrt"><span class="radical">√</span><span class="ignored">(</span><span class="root">2</span><span class="ignored">)</span></span></span>. Now if <span class="formula"><i>AB</i></span> is measured, we’re guaranteed to get <span class="formula"> + 1</span>. However, if we measure <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> first, then we’d get either <span class="formula"> + 1</span> or <span class="formula"> − 1</span>. Say we got <span class="formula"> + 1</span>. The state would be <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[ +  + ]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and thus measuring <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> would always yield <span class="formula"> + 1</span>. Similarly, a measurement for <span class="formula"> − 1</span> and similarly for measuring <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> first. Thus, even though the physical situations are completely different, <span class="formula"><i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>) = <i>m</i>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i>(<i>B</i>)</span>. This completely undermines the argument I was trying to build against contextuality. Looks like QM is afterall multiplicative, although I haven’t exactly proven this.

<ul>
<li>
[research/ms] There’re atleast two interesting directions to pursue at this stage. One is that I try to see what exactly happens for <span class="formula"><i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i></span> s.t. <span class="formula">[<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>] = 0</span> and <span class="formula">[<i>A</i>, <i>C</i>] = 0</span> but <span class="formula">[<i>B</i>, <i>C</i>] ≠ 0</span>. The other is that I try to construct the simulator for BM and see precisely how these values change upon being measured. <br/>
The latter will take quite some time and be useful as a tool in general. I also realized that if one is allowed to update values, then one can violate the KCBS inequality, without caring for which compatible observable was measured before/with. So then in my old notation, non-multiplicativity will arise in the sense that <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>B</i>) ≠ <i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>)</span> in general. However, <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i>)<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>B</i>) = <i>m</i>(<i>AB</i>)</span>. This I suspect will also hold for BM. <br/>
From tomorrow, I will start working on the simulator. I want that table. Then I’ll construct the theory. Should have ‘experimental’ results before attempting construction of a theory (don’t have very solid principles guiding my theory now do I?).<br/>

Finally, if <span class="formula"><i>A</i><sub>13</sub></span> is measured, I get <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub>3</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>13</sub>) = 1</span>. The requirements <span class="formula"><i>C</i><sub>3</sub> =  − 1</span> and <span class="formula"><i>R</i><sub>1</sub> = 1</span> are satisfied, so no changes are required. Ofcourse, <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>33</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>23</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>3</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>13</sub>) =  − 1</span> as required. Note that in principle, <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>33</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>23</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>A</i><sub>13</sub>) = 1 ≠  − 1</span>. Thus the theory is not ‘counterfactually multiplicative’ but is ‘sequentially multiplicative’. *Since the former can’t quite be ‘tested’, we must conclude that Bohmian Mechanics is atmost as speculative, as is contextuality.* <br/>
It is also true, that the memory model was not ‘counterfactually multiplicative’ but was ‘sequentially multiplicative’. The point is that beyond this stage, since both models require the possibility of updating the internal state after a measurement is made, it is simpler to just update all commuting variables, rather than making the model ‘contextual’. Contextuality in this light, is not a necessity, but merely a possibility.<br/>
Further, one can almost show that QM is multiplicative. Consider two operators <span class="formula"><i>Â</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span>. Let us assume that <span class="formula">∃</span> a <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>AB</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>λ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. For simplicity, assume that <span class="formula"><i>λ</i> = 1</span>. We now show that the most general <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> can be written as a superposition of those simultaneous eigenkets of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span>, that satisfy <span class="formula"><i>ab</i> = <i>λ</i> = 1</span>. Let us start with <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>α</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[00]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <i>β</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[01]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <i>γ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[10]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <i>δ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[11]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, where <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>[**]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> represent eigenkets of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span>; <span class="formula"><i>A</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[01]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">|</span>[01]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[10]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> = 1<span class="symbol">|</span>[10]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> for example. Now <span class="formula"><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>α</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[00]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <i>β</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[01]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <i>γ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[10]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <i>δ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[11]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, and <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><i>Â</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>α</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[00]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <i>β</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[01]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> − <i>γ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[10]<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <i>δ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>[11]<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Comparing this to <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, we get <span class="formula"><i>α</i> = <i>α</i></span>, <span class="formula"><i>β</i> =  − <i>β</i></span>, <span class="formula">…</span>. Consequently, <span class="formula"><i>β</i>, <i>γ</i> = 0</span>. This proves that the most general <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> can be written as a superposition of kets s.t. <span class="formula"><i>ab</i> = 1</span>. Multiplicativity directly follows from this, as any measurement of <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> or <span class="formula"><i>B</i></span> individually, will collapse the state into one of the simultaneous eigenkets (or their superposition, depending on the degenerecy). <br/>
For the most general proof though, some arguments are missing, which are being worked on.

[research/ms] Wrote down the progress I made yesterday. This I had thought of in the past few days and had confused myself over it. If say <span class="formula"><i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i></span> are s.t. they commute, and <span class="formula"><i>ABC</i> = 1</span>, like the PM setup, then in the measurement process, wouldn’t <span class="formula"><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>Â</i><i>B̂</i><i>Ĉ</i>.<i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></sup> = <i>e</i><sup> − <i>i</i><i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></sup> = <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>Â</i><i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>B̂</i><i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></sup><i>e</i><sup><i>i</i><i>Ĉ</i><i>p̂</i><sub>2</sub></sup></span>. Working now on figuring out how to write the simulator. I think it will be more clear if I implement the ‘theoretical measurement’ scheme, as opposed to working on the magnetic field gradient based approach. <br/>
It looks like it maybe worth studying Page 158, Spins of Bohmian Mechanics by Detlef. Understood how in BM, one can’t ascribe spin to a particle. The argument is simple but it entails that given identical initial conditions (including the hidden variable, viz position), the outcome of a measurement is not fixed. One must also feed the experimental setup. For example, if one reverses the magnetic field gradient, the spin of the particle would turn out to be <span class="formula"> − 1 ⁄ 2</span> instead of <span class="formula"> + 1 ⁄ 2</span> for the exact same initial condition. See the book for details.<br/>
The interesting part for my work was that one can use simple arguments, like the ones used in the book, to measure <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span>. Measuring <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span> however is a little complicated. Either one must turn the particle (which complicates the shape of the gaussian packet, viz. it must be analyzed carefully) or think of the particle beam splitting, along its very direction of propagation; neither are neat.

[research/ms] Took an interesting step forward today. Extended the GHZ test itself, to a full blown test of contextuality. The details, I’ll type later, but see [<a class="Reference" href="#ghzContextuality">Figure 2↓</a>] for a glimpse. The advantage is that I need only measure <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span> (no <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span>), so that simplifies things a lot. In addition, it looks like we (fine I) were (was) spot on about the kind of theories. We will now be able to show how BM is ‘onotologically non-multiplicative’ but non-contextual. However, it is ‘sequentially multiplicative’, as required by QM (which we proved a few days ago). So in essence, we would’ve clarified that while ‘ontologial multiplicativity’ is as much a philosophical speculation (since it can’t be tested at present) as is contextuality. Confusing different measurement settings that yield different answers for the same initial conditions, doesn’t explain ‘contextuality’.

[research/ms] Thought about how one can even do generalized measurements, and yield analytic results by assuming that the measuring particle is at a particular location. The idea is infact quite simple. The wavefunction of the measuring particle gets split, depending the state of the ‘system’. After splitting of this wavefunction, in which constituent ‘wavefunction’ the measuring particle will sit, will depend, by the same token as the Stern Gerlach analysis, on the initial position of the measuring particle. Effectively then, if the measuring particle is assumed to be at the top most position, it would follow that the eigenstate (of the observable that we intend to measure) with the most negative eigenvalue, will be the outcome.<br/>
This did however, get me thinking about how exactly the ‘collapse’ is explained in BM. (This was thought of while having lunch, bathing etc. Not exactly while in the office)

[research/ms] Met with Arvind sir. He suggested I try constructing an explicit model that resolves the issue. I realized that there’s a lot that needs to be added to the draft. I will attempt doing that soon enough. It was concluded that we arrive at an explicit assignment using BM, s.t. the theory is non-multiplicative (’ontologically’) but is sequentially multiplicative; in addition the theory is non-contextual and finally combine all previous ideas to show that contextuality is speculative and that any true demonstration of contextuality, will render BM false.<br/>

Let <span class="formula"><i>m</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>Ô</i>)</span> refer to the outcome of measuring an operator <span class="formula"><i>Ô</i></span>, where <span class="formula"><i>i</i></span> parametrizes the sequence of the measurement. Sequential multiplicativity is the statement that <span class="formula"><i>m</i>(<i>P̂</i>) = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>P̂</i><sub>1</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>P̂</i><sub>2</sub>) = <i>m</i><sub>1</sub>(<i>P̂</i><sub>2</sub>)<i>m</i><sub>2</sub>(<i>P̂</i><sub>1</sub>)</span>. The proof is simple. Consider a set of compatible operators, which are also complete. For simplicity, let’s say the set is given by <span class="formula"><i>S</i> = {<i>P̂</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>P̂</i><sub>2</sub>}</span> (not anti-commutation, its a set). Now consider the operator <span class="formula"><i>P̂</i> = <i>P̂</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>P̂</i><sub>2</sub></span>. Let <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> be s.t. <span class="formula"><i>P̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>p</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> but <span class="formula">∄</span> any <span class="formula"><i>λ</i></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>P̂</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>λ</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> (else the result we’re trying to prove will be trivial; as <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> is a simultaneous eigenket of <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span>, with eigenvalues <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub></span>, <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>2</sub></span> and <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub></span>). If you’re uncomfortable with this ‘claim’ or its relevance, one can use <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>1</sub> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub></span>, <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>y</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> so that <span class="formula"><i>P</i> = <i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span>. Now, the state <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> makes for a non-trivial <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Coming to the proof, first we define <span class="formula"><i>P̂</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>note that it suffices for me to show that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> must be a superposition of only those simultaneous eigenkets <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>p</i></span>. This can be proved as follows. Consider <div class="formula">
<span class="environment"><span class="arrayrow">

</span>
<span class="arraycell align-l">

<span class="arraycell align-l">

</span>
<span class="arrayrow">
<span class="arraycell align-l">
  ⇒  <span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">|</span><i>P̂</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span>
</span>
<span class="arraycell align-l">
 = <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span>

<span class="arraycell align-l">
 = 
</span>
<span class="arraycell align-l">
<i>p</i><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span>.
</span>

</span>
</span>
</div>
It follows immediately, that if <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> ≠ 0</span>, then it entails that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> contains <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> as an eigenket in its superposition, and <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = <i>p</i></span>. However, if <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = 0</span>, then we won’t ever see <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>1</sub></span> or <span class="formula"><i>p</i><sub>2</sub></span> as outcomes, so it is irrelevant. That then completes the proof.<br/>
This can be readily generalized to any number of operators, even if they’re not complete (in which case the remaining operators maybe added to complete the set, but the eigenvalues corresponding to them, don’t play any role in the proof, and thus making its extension trivial).

[research/ms] Today figured the final piece of the puzzle. I started with trying to arrive at precise assignments using the <span class="formula"><i>e</i><sup><i>ia</i><i>Ô</i>⊗<i>p̂</i></sup></span> type of hamiltonian. It was taking a lot of effort. Finally realized that I can just abstract out the Bohmain Mechanics by using a coin toss for making assignments in case the system is not in the eigenstate. [todo: add details, board clips etc.] Got a chance to talk to Arvind sir also, for a few minutes only though, but was able to convey the idea to him, atleast partially. Explained it to Kishor and he seemed to have been convinced (atleast distractedly) about the accuracy (but I could still be wrong).

[research/ms] Discussed the developments so far with Prof. Arvind. He seemed perplexed about the contextual assignment of values. Did seem finally convinced. However, towards the end he made a remark that we shouldn’t start with <span class="formula"><span class="array"><span class="arrayrow">

</span>
</span></span>. This I should clarify with him, that this assignment is necessary for predicting values for the first time and hence not optional. <br/>
The <i>first interesting</i> thing that sir had pointed out, in context of multiplicativity, was that one can measure a super operator <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i></span> that can, in a single shot, measure all ‘compatible’ operators. His point was that then I know the values all these operators had, and thus the assignment must be consistent, even ‘ontologically’. However, that isn’t true. We can show this by the following simple example. Consider the state <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="symbol">(</span><span class="symbol">|</span>000<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>011<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>101<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + <span class="symbol">|</span>110<span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">)</span> ⁄ 2</span>. Let the computational basis be written as <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>i</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, where <span class="formula"><i>i</i></span> is the decimal of the binary equivalent. Let <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i></span> be a super operator, given by <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i> = <i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span><i>i</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>i</i><span class="symbol">|</span></span>, which is just a diagonal matrix. Now a measurement of <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> will yield either 0, 3, 5 or 6. Now consider the operators <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><sub>1</sub> = <span class="blackboard"> I</span>⊗<span class="blackboard">I</span>⊗<i>σ̂</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>,  <i>B̂</i><sub>2</sub> = <span class="blackboard"> I</span>⊗<i>σ̂</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<span class="blackboard">I</span></span> and <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><sub>3</sub> = <i>σ̂</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<span class="blackboard">I</span>⊗<span class="blackboard">I</span></span>. In this example, <span class="formula"><i>Ĉ</i> = <i>B̂</i><sub>1</sub><i>B̂</i><sub>2</sub><i>B̂</i><sub>3</sub></span>. Now if I measure <span class="formula"><i>Ĉ</i></span>, I will always get a +1, and the state will never collapse. However, if I measure <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span>, I may get a <span class="formula">±1</span> independently. A measurement of <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i></span> will yield one of the values as stated, which would uniquely determine the values one gets for <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> <i>after</i> <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i></span> has been measured, viz. if <span class="formula"><i>B̂</i><sub><i>i</i></sub></span> are measured thereafter, they will agree with the values one would deduce from the outcome of measuring <span class="formula"><i>Ŝ</i></span>. We can’t (atleast in no way conceivable presently) contradict (because QM is silent on that note) non-multiplicativity. I know this needs to be written properly, but the idea is roughly there. <br/>
The <i>second interesting</i> thing that was raised, was whether the statistics of QM can be matched, for all states <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. I was under the impression that the said algorithm will work, but it won’t. Consider <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = cos<i>θ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>00<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + sin<i>θ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>11<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Obviously a measurement of <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub>⊗<i>σ</i><sub><i>z</i></sub></span> using the coin toss model will fail to get the right statistics.<br/>
Other than this, Jaskaran didn’t seem convinced of the accuracy of the model. He said that the assignments should be state independent, because contextuality is a statement about observables, and is state independent (he didn’t want to bring in state dependence). That was one. He felt that the model is a sort of simulation of PM situation only and wasn’t anything different or new. He suggested I look at ‘Contextuality for preparations, tranformations and measurements’ by Robert Spekkers.

[research/ms] Figured how to fix the statistics in general, again motivated by Bohmian Mechanics. One could start with choosing a random number <span class="formula"><i>c</i> ∈ [0, 1]</span> (uniformly random). Then one finds <span class="formula"><i>P</i><sub> − </sub> = <span class="symbol">|</span><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>p</i><sub> − </sub>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">|</span><sup>2</sup></span> and then assigns <span class="formula"> − 1</span> if <span class="formula"><i>c</i> &lt; <i>P</i><sub> − </sub></span>, else <span class="formula"> + 1</span> is assigned.<br/>
Further, Jaskaran claims to have found a mistake with my argument. Will listen to it, when he’s available.

[research/ms] I found this <a href="http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.012102">http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.79.012102</a> today. Title of the paper: ‘‘Quantum contextuality in the Mermin-Peres square: A hidden-variable perspective&rdquo; and here’s a quote from the abstract: ‘‘...To prove that such a description is possible, an explicit and, in this sense, noncontextual hidden-variable model is constructed, which reproduces all quantum theoretic predictions for the Mermin-Peres square...&rdquo;. Now I can’t find this on arxiv and therefore can’t be certain how different it is from my work, but anyway. In addition there’re discussions <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3052.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3052.pdf</a> on how contextuality can’t really be proven experimentally. <br/>
Other than this, spent most of my time, on trying to write the poster. Some of the results include <a class="Reference" href="#fig:researchFlow">Figure 4↓</a>. The rough points of the draft have already been made.<br/>
Finally, I also figured how one can ‘complete’ quantum mechanics using just a single hidden variable and make each operator have a predictable value. This sounds particularly interesting in the light of contextuality tests etc. In addition, I realized one can quickly show how values assigned to operators, may still depend on how they’re measured; viz. the stern gerlach and direct value assigned to the operator can be shown to be different, effectively saying that one can’t associate spin with a particle. However, that doesn’t give rise to any inconsistency, since the theory is non-multiplicative. In addition to this, it also appears that one maybe able to turn the argument around and show that one can’t associate even positions with particles. Now that would be seriously interesting and against BM. Perhaps then, it would remain how to construct an appropriate Hamiltonian, given an observable <span class="formula"><i>O</i></span>, so that <span class="formula"><i>O</i></span> can be measured using <span class="formula"><i>O</i>’</span>, some other observable. One can also compare trajectories. I also seem to remember RS conjecturing the maximal completeness of their theory. Perhaps this theory is effectively doing that. But a little though reveals that in this sense, even BM is maximally complete. So I’m guessing I remember the conjecture wrong. It also seems that one can show, within this simplistic framework, how non-locality and contextuality are related.<br/>
In hindsight, it appears to me that even RS were doing something mysteriously similar. My idea was simply to construct a cumulative probability distribution, by ordering the the outcomes based on eigenvalues (of whichever operator) and then using this single hidden variable to identify which event will happen. This is guaranteed to work because cumulatives are monotonic and increasing. It also has traces of this problem I thought about a long time ago in Bag’s course, where I had to convert a uniform random distribution into an arbitrary random distribution.

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
[research/ms] Various interesting ideas were discussed today. Let me start with the one that I had figured yesterday, or atleast appreciated properly enough then. We want to create a minimalistic hidden variable theory, in which only one hidden variable is assumed, and the outcomes of all experiments are predicted in the simplest conceivable way. Here it is.<br/>
1. Initial: You’re given <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>; Choose a <span class="formula"><i>c</i> ∈ (0, 1)</span><br/>
2. Assignment/Prediction: Given an operator <span class="formula"><i>Â</i></span>, find its eigenkets <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>a</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> and note that <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span> = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><sub><i>a</i></sub><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>a</i>|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span><span class="symbol">|</span><i>a</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. Define <span class="formula"><i>c</i><sub><i>a</i></sub> = <span class="limits"><span class="limit">∑</span></span><span class="scripts"><sup class="script"><i>a</i></sup><sub class="script"><i>a</i>’ = <i>a</i><sub><i>min</i></sub></sub></span><span class="symbol">⟨</span><i>a</i>’|<i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>. The value assigned to <span class="formula"><i>Â</i></span> is <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> s.t. <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> is the smallest eigenvalue, for which <span class="formula"><i>c</i> ≤ <i>c</i><sub><i>a</i></sub></span>. (for example, for <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub> = <i>A</i></span>, <span class="formula">cos<i>θ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>0<span class="symbol">⟩</span> + sin<i>θ</i><span class="symbol">|</span>1<span class="symbol">⟩</span></span>, <span class="formula"><i>σ</i><sub><i>x</i></sub></span> is assigned 0, if <span class="formula"><i>c</i> ≤ cos<sup>2</sup><i>θ</i></span>) <br/>
3. After measuring, choose a new <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span> and update <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">⟩</span></span> using the measurement postulate of QM, consistently with the value assigned in step 2.<br/>
This has various interesting consequences (there’s also an issue with the value of the spin operator and stern gerlach based value deduction etc.) It is especially interesting to note that this has to be non-multiplicative and peculiarities associated with it.<br/>
The next interesting thing which was discussed, was observed and raised by Bhati. He proposed an interesting test to distinguish QM from BM. The essence of the idea was that one asks, what are the bounds in time, given for photons to arrive, at a given area (say the minima band) on the screen. He said that since according to BM, only a small set of trajectories (very close) should arrive at the screen, their time must be bounded; whereas according to the path integral picture, he claimed that this time is not bounded. This was eventually resolved by using the probability distribution <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i>(<i>q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>q</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>t</i>)</span> at the initial and final time to note that we will have an arc like set of dots (in the contour plot of <span class="formula"><i>ψ</i></span>, for a later time) and perhaps the Gaussian in it make the time unbounded. So that was sorted. Interesting questions were raised about how to calculate the time corresponding to a path that the electron takes and about the time difference between the rays that interfere and their repercussion on single photon experiments.<br/>
Finally, Jaskaran downloaded the paper for me. It turns out that the paper has a much more elaborate discussion and mine seems much more simple and straight forward. Also, he told me the issue with my construction; in a line, he said that it doesn’t yield a joint probability distribution, which he demands mustn’t change after measurement.

[research/ms] Recall the conjecture that BM trajectories could effectively be evaluated using my <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span>-variable theory. The proof of it should hinge on the fact that according to BM, the distribution of the particles preserves the <span class="formula"><span class="symbol">|</span><i>ψ</i><span class="symbol">|</span><sup>2</sup></span> distribution. Also, I realized one can show that there’re effectively infinite hidden variable theories and there’re very few constraints on how one must construct them.

[course/Cosmology] Term paper; working on figuring the jacobian issue. Interestingly, figured that one needn’t have to evaluate the jacobian explicitly. Doing the radial part only also (in principle the other method should also but anyway) gives you correct answers. Talked to Bag about the next step, that requires fourier transforms. He explained to me the overall picture. The fourier transforms I tried, no luck. Went to see Bag again and he told me to take a single mode (without sum). That I came back and tried; did various wrong things, without much luck. Figured finally what was wrong and got an answer. The answer won’t match though :(

<ul>
<li>
[course/Cosmology] Term paper; everything looked reasonable, couldn’t figure what I was doing wrong. Finally figured it (upto a sign), while waiting for Bagla sir outside his office; I was making an assumption which wasn’t required. That fixed things. Made some polar plots also. Was confused though, about <span class="formula"><i>r̂</i>.<i>k̂</i></span>.
</li>
<li>
[misc.] Kishor gave a QCQI talk. Couldn’t understand the example. It was suggested he’ll explain next time. I was also a little confused about the theorem about how if one assumes at best a pre-shared algorithm and no-signalling, one can show that all corelations will arise from local hidden variables.

[course/Cosmology] Updated the term paper, after discussing the doubts with Bagla sir; Also worked while watching the match, it was fun. Also completed the presentation (by stripping the extra words off of the term paper).

[misc.] Jaskaran had a small doubt: The question was that after applying an projector <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span>, the state should be <span class="formula"><span class="text">Tr</span><sub><i>A</i></sub>(<i>P</i><sup>†</sup>(<i>ρ</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>⊗<i>ρ</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>)<i>P</i>)</span> and not <span class="formula"><span class="text">Tr</span><sub><i>A</i></sub>((<i>ρ</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>⊗<i>ρ</i><sub><i>A</i></sub>)<i>P</i>)</span> as is the case for finding the expectation from <span class="formula"><span class="text">Tr</span>(<i>ρ</i><sub><i>S</i></sub>⊗<i>ρ</i><sub><i>A</i></sub><i>P</i>)</span>. The difficulty ofcourse was figured and resolved by deriving all the relevant quantities.

<li>
[teaching/Thermodynamics] Studied chapter 5 from Callen’s book. Looked at the notions of quasi static and reversible more carefully. Also looked at the maximum work theorem (saying that the max work that can be delivered, must come from a reversible path).

<div class="Unindented">
The following has been taken from an email written to Ali Asadian.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--1"></a>[background] 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
As you know, in the GHZ test, one is able to show that determinism can’t hold. However, this is done using spins. How this is handled in Bohmian Mechanics (BM) has been discussed already<span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-6" href="#biblio-6"><span class="bib-index">6</span></a>]</span>. It is not in direct contradiction with BM because spins are not treated like (q,p). In BM, (q,p) are well defined, just that we can’t observe them. However, spins in BM are only a property of the wavefunction and not postulated to have well defined ‘values’ like (q,p). Thus, while it is interesting to see how BM handles being deterministic and consistent with GHZ, it’s not too surprising to see it work, since spins aren’t assumed deterministic like (q,p).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--2"></a>[thesis problem] 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Do you recall the GHZ paper that had been extended to continuous variables? The point was that this particular approach showed that there can’t be determinism for (q,p). However, BM seems to be an example that does precisely this. How can this be? It is precisely this that I intend to explore in my thesis. If BM’s predictions differ from QM, then we at once have a wonderful test to find which theory is correct. If the predictions match, as is more likely, we’ll be closer to answering to atleast two important questions. (1) Which extra assumption goes into the GHZ like tests which is unaccounted and (2) How contextuality emerges from non-locality, especially in continuous variables.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--3"></a>[future scope] 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Ofcourse, a more ambitious goal would be to look at your results <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-4" href="#biblio-4"><span class="bib-index">4</span></a>]</span> on contextuality in continuous variables and use BM to understand the relation of non locality with it more directly. Perhaps if I have enough time, I’ll pursue that as well. The one question which I still haven’t an answer to is the following: How is it that, while formally in QM, spins and (q,p) are handled very similarly, why can’t we extend BM in a manner to include spins as ’deterministic’ as are (q,p)? I would like to either find such a formulation or show that it doesn’t exist. This is of great interest for this answer must depend on the fundamental difference between spins and (q,p) as properties. The thesis problem is a step in this direction.
