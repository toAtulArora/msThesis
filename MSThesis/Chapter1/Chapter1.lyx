\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A course in Quantum Mechanics (QM) typically leaves the reader with a fuzzy
 view of the world.
 The founders of the subject, were able to abstract out the mathematics
 from it's implications and interpretation.
 The view that the wavefunction is the most complete description of a system,
 known as the `Orthodox Copenhagen Interpretation', is among the most popular.
 Einstein and Bohm, both played an important role in challenging this belief.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Einstein showed that if one makes reasonable assumptions about nature (apparentl
y these were in spirit with his relativity theories), then QM must be incomplete.
 By incompleteness, he meant that the results of certain experiments should
 be predictable precisely, but QM fails at doing this.
 Thus he concluded that, QM must be treated as an intermediate theory and
 that a more complete description of nature should be possible.
 We will come back to this discussion.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Bohm challenged this view by realizing that one can't experimentally refute
 the interpretation.
 His argument was that if for instance, the predictions of QM fail to match
 with experiments, then one can always add appropriate terms in the Hamiltonian
 until the difficulty is resolved.
 He was already anticipating the modern form of particle physics, where
 to accurately account for interactions between particles, one can postulate
 new force mediating particles, which was also done in the history of the
 subject, but can't refute the interpretation due to inaccuracy in predictions.
 He therefore, aimed at, and succeeded at constructing a complete quantum
 theory, now known as Bohmian Mechanics (BM), existence of which, would
 show that we are not justified at believing the interpretation, simply
 because there exist other alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to Einstein, as will be described in more detail, Bell was able
 to construct a physical situation, that would test the very requirements
 Einstein imposed on a complete quantum theory; he was able to show that
 according to predictions of QM, such a complete description is impossible.
 This was verified experimentally (and was confirmed to be true, without
 any possible loop-holes, only recently in 2015).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It might appear that Bell's test shows that QM is inconsistent with BM,
 but upon looking at the details, one can be convinced, that this is not
 the case.
 Infact, Bell was among the first few to popularize BM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussion so far, is well known in the literature.
 However, certain developments which followed the said work of Bohm, again
 lead to apparent inconsistencies between BM and QM, which hadn't been satisfact
orily addressed in the literature.
 These are the subject of the thesis.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For the sake of completeness, we merely name these, for one must look at
 the details, to be able to appreciate them.
 Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (GHZ), constructed a test that apparently
 showed determinism, the notion that observables have pre-defined values,
 can't exist.
 Developments due to Gleason, Bell himself, Kochen, Specker, Peres and Mermin,
 showed that the value an operator takes, must depend on the context in
 which it is measured; context here refers to the complete set of compatible
 operators.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The apparent contradiction must now be clear; BM is deterministic and it
 is at odds with the notion of contextuality as well.

The EPR argument

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The EPR argument requires an entangled state, over two particles, which
 was originally written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\psi(x_{1},x_{2})=\int e^{-i(x_{1}-x_{2}+x_{0})p/\hbar}dp=\delta(x_{1}-x_{2}+x_{0}).
\]

\end_inset

In the modern notation, one can write this as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\psi\right\rangle  & = & \int\delta(x_{1}-x_{2}+x_{0})dx_{1}dx_{2}\left|x_{1}\right\rangle _{1}\left|x_{2}\right\rangle _{2}\\
 & = & \int\left|x\right\rangle _{1}\left|x+x_{0}\right\rangle _{2}dx.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Similarly, one can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\psi\right\rangle  & = & \int e^{-i(x_{1}-x_{2})p/\hbar}dpdx_{1}dx_{2}\left|x_{1}\right\rangle _{1}\left|x_{2}\right\rangle _{2}\\
 & = & \int e^{-ix_{1}p/\hbar}\left|x_{1}\right\rangle _{1}dx_{1}e^{ix_{2}p/\hbar}\left|x_{2}\right\rangle _{2}dx_{2}dp\\
 & = & \int\left|p\right\rangle _{1}\left|-p\right\rangle _{2}dp.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where the first ket is that of the first particle, and second that of the
 second.
 An attempt to reproduce the precise argument, will not be made.
 Instead, we satisfy ourselves with the following simplified argument.
 We assume the principle of locality holds, which is to say that if two
 particles are sufficiently far away, then any change made to one particle,
 should not influence the other instantaneously.
 Given this assumption, consider two particles, which are sufficiently far
 away and that their state is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Now if the momentum of particle 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is measured by observer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, then observer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, according to QM, will be able to predict the momentum of particle 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, if the position of particle 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is measured, then observer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 can predict the position of particle 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 However, since the choice made by observer 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, can't influence particle 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 (by the assumption of locality), it follows that particle 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 had both it's position and momentum well defined, without being measured.
 Since QM fails to yield the answer with precision, whereas as we have shown,
 the answer was precise, we are forced to conclude that QM is not a complete
 description of nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Einstein ended his paper with this remark: ``While we have thus shown that
 the wave function does not provide a complete description of the physical
 reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description
 exists.
 We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.''
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bell's Theorem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bell's work addresses and satisfactorily answers Einstein's open question,
 of whether a 
\emph on
such
\emph default
 a description exists.
 Consider the following scenario.
 There are two observers, A and B, each has a particle.
 Each observer, can measure two properties, call them 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{1},\hat{a}_{2}$
\end_inset

 for observer A and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}_{1},\hat{b}_{2}$
\end_inset

 for observer B, which yield a 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 outcome.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{a}_{i}\hat{b}_{j}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 represent the average value obtained by measuring the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 on the first and second particle respectively.
 Consider the average given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle =\left\langle \hat{a}_{1}\hat{b}_{1}\right\rangle +\left\langle \hat{a}_{1}\hat{b}_{2}\right\rangle +\left\langle \hat{a}_{2}\hat{b}_{1}\right\rangle -\left\langle \hat{a}_{2}\hat{b}_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 If one assumes local realism
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Infact, an argument similar to EPR can be used to show that locality entails
 realism.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, that is that the values 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 takes are unaffected by those taken by 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{i},\hat{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 have pre-defined values (respectively), then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle \le2$
\end_inset

.
 One can check this quickly by a brute force substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 values, in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i},b_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now, the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left(\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{x}\left|\pm\right\rangle =\pm\left|\pm\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}_{x,y,z}$
\end_inset

 are the Pauli matrices.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{1}=\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}_{2}=\hat{\sigma}_{x}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}_{1}=-\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{z}+\hat{\sigma}_{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{b}_{2}=\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{z}-\hat{\sigma}_{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Upon evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 using the rules of QM, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{B}\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}\nleq2$
\end_inset

.
 This entails that our assumption, that of local realism, must be incorrect,
 which settles the question: A 
\emph on
local
\emph default
 hidden variable description can not exist.
 The word hidden is used to represent information about the state of the
 system, that is not contained in the wavefunction.
 It is instructive to emphasize that a non-local description, may still
 be possible.
 It is also important to note that, despite this non-locality, one can't
 use QM to send signals instantaneously (superluminal communication is not
 possible).
 This is known as the no-signalling theorem and can be proven by showing
 that marginals in QM, don't depend on the system which is traced out (TODO).

Bohm's Theory, Bohmian Mechanics (condensed introduction)
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bohm gave a precise, but non-local description of quantum phenomena.
 Let us start with non-interacting particles.
 A particle is associated with (1) a position, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 & momentum, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, precisely defined and (2) a wavefunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=Re^{iS/\hbar}$
\end_inset

.
 The postulates of the theory are: (a) Evolution of the wavefunction, is
 governed by Schrodinger's equation: 
\begin_inset Formula $i\hbar\partial\psi/\partial t=-(\hbar^{2}/2m)\nabla^{2}\psi+V\psi$
\end_inset

.
 (b) The particle is guided by the wavefunction: 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}=p/m$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\nabla S=\hbar\text{Im}(\nabla\psi/\psi)$
\end_inset

.
 (c) The initial distribution of the particles is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)=\left|\psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The astute reader would've noticed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla S$
\end_inset

 is just the probability current, which entails that if the initial distribution
 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi(t_{0})\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

, then it will do so at all times 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, thereafter.
 Before generalizing this to multiple particles, let us first see a quick
 consequence of this formulation.
 In the Orthodox Copenhagen interpretation, the double slit experiment is
 a source of mystery and the which slit question, that of confusion.
 In BM, since trajectories are well defined, one observes (TODO: add image)
 that the particle goes through precisely one slit and then later, forms
 the interference pattern.
 The wavefunction goes through both slits, and interferes to create the
 pattern.
 If one of the slits is blocked, then as expected, since the wavefunction
 can't interfere, the pattern is lost.
 We haven't spoken about measuring the particle yet, but if one notes that
 to measure the particle, the potential at one of the slits must be changed,
 then it is immediate that the interference pattern will be effected, since
 the wavefunction is affected by the potential at both slits, even if the
 particle passes through only one.
 One finds that by using the following multi-particle generalization, and
 an appropriate measuring scheme, one can show more precisely how the process
 of measuring effectively destroys the pattern, replacing the mystery with
 clarity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 interacting particles, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\nabla_{i}S(q_{1},q_{2},\dots,q_{N})$
\end_inset

 where note that the momentum of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 particle, depends on the instantaneous positions of all the particles.
 Consequently, BM is an explicitly non-local, but complete description.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(TODO: change the x axis to z, and change explicit reference to x,y,z in
 favour of q_x, q_y, q_z etc.) As a final remark, it must be added that spins
 can also be included in BM, however, a particle is not associated with
 a specific spin, only it's wavefunction is.
 For a spinor, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\equiv(\psi_{+},\psi_{-})^{T}$
\end_inset

, the generalization is that 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\hbar\text{Im}((\psi,\nabla\psi)/(\psi,\psi))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $(.,.)$
\end_inset

 represents inner product in the spin space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 A quick illustration is in order.
 Consider the following Stern-Gerlach setup; Quantum effects are considered
 only along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis.
 A particle moves along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-axis, with speed 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{z}$
\end_inset

, and it's initial wavefunction, given by a Gaussian centred at the origin,
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)=(1/\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma)e^{-x^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}$
\end_inset

, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\int dx\psi(x)\left|x\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 It's spin state is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\chi\right\rangle =\left(\left|0\right\rangle +\left|1\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 represent computational basis.
 Along the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

-axis, a strong heterogeneous magnetic field is present, whose action maybe
 captured by 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\text{int}}=a\hat{p}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is a constant that quantifies the strength of the field.
 Why this particular form works, will become clear momentarily.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is large enough to neglect effects of free-evolution, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{U}(t)=e^{-ia\hat{p}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}t/\hbar}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if the initial state is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi\right\rangle \otimes\left|\chi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\Psi(t)\right\rangle  & = & \hat{U}(t)\left|\Psi\right\rangle \\
 & = & \frac{e^{-ia\hat{p}_{x}t/\hbar}\left|\psi\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +e^{ia\hat{p}_{x}t/\hbar}\left|\psi\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\\
 & = & \frac{\left|\psi_{at}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{-at}\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{x_{0}}\right\rangle \equiv\int dx\psi(x-x_{0})\left|x\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, viz.
 a Gaussian wavepacket centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 One can plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

, as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, using 
\begin_inset Formula $z=v_{z}t$
\end_inset

, schematically as shown in the figure (TODO: put the figure), where regions
 enclosing, say 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 have been outlined.
 So far, according to QM, if we measure the position of the particle, then
 (given 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\ll at$
\end_inset

), obtaining the particle near 
\begin_inset Formula $x=at$
\end_inset

, is as probably as finding it near 
\begin_inset Formula $x=-at$
\end_inset

.
 QM doesn't make a deterministic prediction at this stage.
 According to BM, if in addition to the wavefunction, we assume that the
 particle was initially at some 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

, then we can predict precisely where the particle will turn up.
 Infact, one can accomplish this with essentially no calculation.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}=\nabla S/m$
\end_inset

, a single valued function, it follows that trajectories of particles won't
 intersect, where recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=Re^{iS/\hbar}$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, a particle that starts with 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

, must follow the `up' trajectory, else by symmetry, the trajectories will
 have to intersect.
 We conclude therefore, that if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

 initially, the particle has spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x<0,$
\end_inset

 the spin must be 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 This appears very clear and intuitive.
 A non-intuitive aspect of this, is that we can't associate spins with particles
, even though we can predict precisely, the outcome of the experiment.
 This is manifested by the observation that if 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\text{int}}\to-H_{\text{int}}$
\end_inset

, which practically amounts to reversing the heterogeneity of the magnet,
 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}\left|\Psi(t)\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{-at}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{at}\right\rangle \otimes\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Again, if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>0$
\end_inset

 initially for a particle, it will follow the `up' trajectory.
 However, now this corresponds to spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, as opposed spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 We have thus demonstrated that we can't associate spin uniquely to a particle,
 and that it must only be associated with the wavefunction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an aside, it may be added that BM is known for removing the fundamental
 role of an observer from the description of QM.
 This is accomplished, roughly speaking, by introducing the positions of
 particles as well defined, and then explaining the `collapse' of wavefunction,
 by means of the particle's interaction with those in the environment, which
 entails that the `collapsed wavefunction' serves as an effective wavefunction,
 which can be used to describe the motion of the particle henceforth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Determinism: The GHZ test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One drawback of Bell's test, was that it's statistical nature.
 The GHZ test, takes this a step further and shows that one can't even conceive
 of having pre-defined values.
 The construction requires three observers with one particles each.
 Each observer can measure two properties, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, with outcomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

.
 We start with the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}\left|\chi_{G}\right\rangle =\left|000\right\rangle -\left|111\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and note that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}:=\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\left|\chi_{G}\right\rangle =\left|\chi_{G}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, where the property 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is the projection of spin of the particle along the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-axis and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is that along the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-axis.
 Thus a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (the first observer measures 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and the other measure 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

), will yield 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 with certainty.
 Next, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}:=\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}:=\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\end_inset

, which by symmetry, must also yield 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 for the said state.
 If these observables, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 had predefined values, then a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 would be equivalent to measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}:=\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

s appear twice for each particle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y^{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since a measurement of each 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A},$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

 yields a 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, it follows that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}$
\end_inset

 therefore, must also yield 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}\left|\chi_{G}\right\rangle =-\left|\chi_{G}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, which entails that a measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{D}$
\end_inset

 must yield a 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we arrive at a contradiction and conclude that the assumption that
 the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 had predefined values, must be incorrect.

There've been various developments, of which the simplest, with effectively
 the same consequence, is discussed: the Peres Mermin test.
 In this test also, we will show that pre-defined values can't exist, but
 in addition, also define the notion of contextuality.
 Consider the following set of operators 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{A}_{ij}\doteq\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\mathbb{I}} & \hat{\mathbb{I}}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} & \hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y}\\
\hat{\sigma}_{y}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{x} & \hat{\sigma}_{x}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{y} & \hat{\sigma}_{z}\otimes\hat{\sigma}_{z}
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

which have the peculiar property that all operators along a row (and along
 a column) commute.
 It is trivial to see that this holds for the first two rows and the first
 two columns.
 To see that this holds also for the last row and column, note the anti-commutat
ion relation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{\sigma}_{x},\hat{\sigma}_{y}\}=0$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}=i\sigma_{y}\sigma_{x}$
\end_inset

, which one may check explicitly.
 Another interesting property is that the product of rows (columns) yield
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{i}=\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}_{j}=\mathbb{I}\,(j\neq3)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}_{3}=-\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

, (
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\,i,j$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{i}\equiv\prod_{j}\hat{A}_{ij}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}_{j}\equiv\prod_{i}\hat{A}_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be verified easily by using the aforesaid relations and the fact
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, for every Pauli matrix.
 Using this property of 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{j}$
\end_inset

, it is easy to show that no pre-defined values for operators can exist.
 Let us assume that pre-defined values do exist.
 Note that to get 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{3}=-1$
\end_inset

, we must have an odd number of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assignments in the third column.
 In the remaining columns, the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assignments must be even for each column.
 Thus, in the entire square, the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assignments must be odd.
 Let us use the same reasoning, but along the rows.
 Since each 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{i}=1$
\end_inset

, we must have even number of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assignments along each row.
 Thus, in the entire square, the number of 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 assignments must be even.
 We have arrived at a contradiction and therefore we conclude that our assumptio
n that operators have predefined values, must be wrong.
 Note that unlike the GHZ test, the Peres Mermin test is state independent.

\begin_layout Standard
We are now in a position to discuss the notion of contextuality.
 We begin with defining a non-contextual assignment to be one, where the
 assignment depends only on the state (
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 + hidden variables, if any) and the operator to which the assignment is
 being made.
 It follows that we had tacitly assumed a non-contextual assignment, that
 resulted in a contradiction.
 If we allow for the value of an operator, to depend on the context in which
 it is measured, where the context is meant to refer to a set of compatible
 observables, then the contradiction won't arise.
 For instance, if we imagine that all observables yield a 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

, except 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{33}$
\end_inset

 which yields a 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 if measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{32},\,\hat{A}_{31}$
\end_inset

 and yields a 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

 if measured with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{23},\,\hat{A}_{13}$
\end_inset

.
 If this doesn't appear entirely unsatisfactory, then you're on the right
 track and are encouraged to read the more detailed description given in
 Section [??].
